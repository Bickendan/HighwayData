Notes on routes:
* BR-163 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-26.7613956,-53.5006317,3a,38.7y,131.6h,89.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGTORPksVAK74cp6ryovMQg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) along the BR-282 overlap.
* What GIS shows as BR-163A [was formerly signed as BR-163](https://www.google.com/maps/@-26.2576834,-53.6188586,3a,15y,196.07h,83.21t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suDBUdBDrFHIxajA2DHTY2A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).
* BR-477 seems to be unsigned, including the branch into Blumenau shown on GIS and the state map.
* BR-480's south end is shown at Rua Libia in GIS, but there seems to be no signage inside the bypass, and the character of the road and signs changes there.
