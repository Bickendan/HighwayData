Notes on routes:
* BR-101: The U-turns need to be checked, since they were still under construction when GMSV went through.
* BR-316 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-9.4668293,-36.1816166,3a,27.7y,132.81h,87.68t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxfrlMpSauX24H5WHPD7ImA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) on the portion that GIS shows is state-maintained. [An ancient sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-8.896689,-37.8333487,3a,15.5y,162.97h,85.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sMTtHj1Ol4h0d8VdJxdJXSg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) stands near Inaj√°; that plus the recent paving should be enough to make BR-316 continuous.
