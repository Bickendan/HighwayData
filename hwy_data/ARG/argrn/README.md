**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- Unsigned GSJs should be named with `RN9_U111` style. The U index could be anything, e.g. derived from the nearest km / mile post. See http://forum.travelmapping.net/index.php?topic=3620
- RN1 is not signed (but the vast majority is in argsf as AuBALP)
- RN3 (and RN40) has been realigned to bypass Rio Gallegos. It is unknown if RN2V03 is signed on the old route.
- RN7 does not use the southern bypass of San Luis according to official sources. Neither route seems to be explicitly signed.
- RN9 overlaps RNA008 according to Eventos de las rutas (it's labeled as a superposition, not an interruption).
- RN9 has a gap in northern Salto (between AvAre_W and the Río Vaqueros bridge), but a route [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.7735826,-65.4148852,3a,38.6y,333.67h,93.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHGudDziXOj7C-J2tJqH1Gg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN173 is unsigned (and unpaved).
- RN281 has been extended west to Chile, but the latest imagery available (2014) shows [RP43](https://www.google.com/maps/@-47.0133625,-67.2598466,3a,44.3y,283.35h,86.5t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shxqOmyhWyFk2rlgJ2XJVxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).

- RNA016 seems to be unsigned.
- RNA026 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-40.7133845,-65.0031998,3a,15y,111.97h,84.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0MpU3xQP1cjCCQyL1beEtA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).

- RN24CB [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-53.8538716,-67.7566283,3a,15y,334.25h,83.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1soEQpmAtRoEjhncm6UfBLZQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) as RNB.
- RN24CI's signage is unknown.
- RN24CJ [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-54.7406811,-67.8312442,3a,32.5y,153.08h,79.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sW5kD7okd-rt2W5A_lccqwg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) as RNJ.

- !! RNA001 et cetera must still being checked if signed !!
- ?? RNV146 to be added ?? (is signed)
