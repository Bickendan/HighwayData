**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- Unsigned GSJs should be named with `RN9_U111` style. The U index could be anything, e.g. derived from the nearest km / mile post. See http://forum.travelmapping.net/index.php?topic=3620
- RN1 is not signed (but the vast majority is in argsf as AuBALP)
- RN3 (and RN40) has been realigned to bypass Rio Gallegos. It is unknown if RN2V03 is signed on the old route.
- RN7 does not use the southern bypass of San Luis according to official sources. Neither route seems to be explicitly signed.
- RN9 overlaps RNA008 according to Eventos de las rutas (it's labeled as a superposition, not an interruption).
- RN9 has a gap in northern Salto (between AvAre_W and the Río Vaqueros bridge), but a route [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.7735826,-65.4148852,3a,38.6y,333.67h,93.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHGudDziXOj7C-J2tJqH1Gg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN12 is signed along both [the bypass of Posadas](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.448722,-56.0298176,3a,15.2y,148.81h,86.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9V9grb9epX59Znexox2iGA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) and [the route thru Posadas](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.4595809,-55.862663,3a,35.8y,17.33h,110.8t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6tjEJzfJnJvotAZ8ljQLVg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). Online official sources showing it using the older route, so that is how the main RN12 file goes, and the bypass is RN12Pos.
- RN120 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.5850308,-56.6350629,3a,32.2y,268.84h,81.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2aRrVadc-cPiupY3YqZP3A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) west of RN12, but other sources show it doesn't extend there.
- RN121 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.5738042,-56.0583919,3a,15.3y,156.54h,84.64t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sMffopIsL0cxvOnO3WZwJlA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) (as of 2014).
- RN122 seems to be unsigned, at least at RN14.
- RN129 [is fully signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-30.2742958,-57.9565668,3a,16.4y,338.09h,88.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqIbfN_Dyamp9qQGaP66BHw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) from RN14, even though all sources show it as RP129. This has been treated as an error, since no sources show that an RN129 ever existed here.
- RN173 is unsigned (and unpaved).
- RN281 has been extended west to Chile, but the latest imagery available (2014) shows [RP43](https://www.google.com/maps/@-47.0133625,-67.2598466,3a,44.3y,283.35h,86.5t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shxqOmyhWyFk2rlgJ2XJVxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).
- RNA010 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-42.7402428,-65.0402514,3a,15y,222.38h,81.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTdSJjwcRVEslE_L6yhXQ_w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) - also note the older sign for [S/N](https://www.google.com/maps/@-42.7405371,-65.040196,3a,15y,229.02h,80.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5RlMASrJTC7peaH2OLRO3w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) (sin nombre/no number).
- RNA011 is only signed at RN11 (GSV) but clearly described on OSM and wikipedia
- RNA015 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-31.2848541,-58.077599,3a,31.5y,64.15h,84.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8WQbdQdHfRW2cr2_fXMDng!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RNA016 seems to be unsigned.
- RNA026 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-40.7133845,-65.0031998,3a,15y,111.97h,84.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0MpU3xQP1cjCCQyL1beEtA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).

- RN24CB [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-53.8538716,-67.7566283,3a,15y,334.25h,83.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1soEQpmAtRoEjhncm6UfBLZQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) as RNB.
- RN24CI's signage is unknown.
- RN24CJ [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-54.7406811,-67.8312442,3a,32.5y,153.08h,79.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sW5kD7okd-rt2W5A_lccqwg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) as RNJ.

- !! RNA001 et cetera must still being checked if signed !!
- ?? RNV146 to be added ?? (is signed)
