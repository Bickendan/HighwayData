**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- Unsigned GSJs should be named with `RN9_U111` style. The U index could be anything, e.g. derived from the nearest km / mile post. See http://forum.travelmapping.net/index.php?topic=3620
- RN 1 is not signed (but the vast majority is in argsf as AutBALP)
- RN 3 (and RN 40) has been realigned to bypass Rio Gallegos. It is unknown if RN 2V03 is signed on the old route.
- RN 7 does not use the southern bypass of San Luis according to official sources. Neither route seems to be explicitly signed.
- RN 1V08 (old RN 8 thru San Antonio de Areco, Capitán Sarmiento, and Arrecifes-Pergamino) is too recently bypassed to know if it is signed.
- RN 9 overlaps RN A008 according to Eventos de las rutas (it's labeled as a superposition, not an interruption).
- RN 9 has a gap in northern Salto (between AvAre_W and the Río Vaqueros bridge), but a route [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.7735826,-65.4148852,3a,38.6y,333.67h,93.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHGudDziXOj7C-J2tJqH1Gg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN 1V09 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-32.9265087,-60.7235596,3a,15y,195.96h,96.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swjRlxtE2QjHmxeXTm03WLA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), [and not only at the east end](https://www.google.com/maps/@-32.7844692,-61.5446597,3a,15y,323.28h,83.43t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sa9o9yRtKAhfoxdfJx3-nHg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN 2V09 seems to be unsigned, but it is in argsf as AutJuaCel.
- RN 3V09 seems to be unsigned.
- RN 12 is signed along both [the bypass of Posadas](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.448722,-56.0298176,3a,15.2y,148.81h,86.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9V9grb9epX59Znexox2iGA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) and [the route thru Posadas](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.4595809,-55.862663,3a,35.8y,17.33h,110.8t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6tjEJzfJnJvotAZ8ljQLVg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). Online official sources showing it using the older route, so that is how the main RN 12 file goes, and the bypass is RN 12Pos.
- RN 20's route in Córdoba is per GIS; Eventos de las rutas is unclear east of ElpGon. However, the left turn westbound at BvSanJuan_W cannot be made, and the right turn eastbound is made using Montevideo and Belgrano.
- RN 1V26 seems to be unsigned (as of 2014).
- RN 1V38 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.3714294,-65.5650386,3a,17.1y,138.3h,105.74t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sc54ghIMfna99TCsEOYysSQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN 1S40 and RN 2S40 seem to be unsigned.
- RN 1V40 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.2176037,-66.3203401,3a,16.7y,315.11h,85.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1siowPiWD_giS60fded_4iaw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN 2V40 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.7190292,-67.1581034,3a,27.2y,55.94h,109.26t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8xtwRUQSdjEoNFVaxHhBsA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) as another route of RN 40, essentially a truck route, but signage on the route itself is unknown. It is mapped as RN 40Lon.
- RN 51 seems to be signed on the bypass of San Antonio de los Cobres, contrary to what GIS shows.
- RN 64 seems to be unsigned east of RN 9.
- RN 1V66 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.4734316,-65.0382964,3a,15.2y,25.41h,89.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sd30ub7F9tkvA91bsgKjqUQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN 73 seems to be unsigned (as of 2014-15).
- RN 95's south end, as signed, seems to be at RP 17 northeast of Ceres (sources show it uses RP 17 to RN 34 in Ceres).
- RN 98 seems to be unsigned at its west end in Pinto (as of 2014), but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.8956185,-62.2676789,3a,28.8y,84.63h,107.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6OEbKWbPeSZG6IUJxxjH2A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) at Bandera.
- RN 89 seems to be poorly signed near its west end, but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.6570494,-62.4292388,3a,75y,250.83h,94.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syBe59wN5pzWYUJ_tlz19RQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) west from Quimilí.
- RN 120 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.5850308,-56.6350629,3a,32.2y,268.84h,81.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2aRrVadc-cPiupY3YqZP3A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) west of RN 12, but other sources show it doesn't extend there.
- RN 121 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.5738042,-56.0583919,3a,15.3y,156.54h,84.64t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sMffopIsL0cxvOnO3WZwJlA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) (as of 2014).
- RN 122 seems to be unsigned, at least at RN 14.
- RN 129 [is fully signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-30.2742958,-57.9565668,3a,16.4y,338.09h,88.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqIbfN_Dyamp9qQGaP66BHw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) from RN 14, even though all sources show it as RP 129. This has been treated as an error, since no sources show that an RN 129 ever existed here.
- RN 131's route thru Strobel is from GIS.
- RN 142 seems to be unsigned (as of 2022).
- RN 146 seems to be completely unsigned thru San Luis, not even with destination signs (as of 2016).
- RN V146 seems to be unsigned.
- RN 153 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-31.9848216,-68.6930735,3a,15y,15.08h,82.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0ribq4Z_QVICb7qDW4MCyg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), but seemingly only west of RN 40.
- RN 173 is unsigned (and unpaved).
- RN 175's easternmost block (on Nerbutti) is blocked off (as of 2023).
- RN 188 seems to be unsigned west of RN 143.
- RN 205 is very consistently signed along what is officially RP 205 (south of [El Jagüel](https://www.google.com/maps/@-34.8326312,-58.4957098,3a,15y,68.34h,102t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9sRL9jBXHKHgE22u_u6EJA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu)), while actual RN 205 is in argsf as AutEzeCan. Signage getting onto the freeway at Ezeiza is confusing; it has been mapped along the route without tolls.
- RN 229 is only defined southbound thru Punta Alta. Signs for Bahia Blanca point northbound along Dorrego, but then disappear when Dorrego ends at Alem. Thus only the southbound route is mapped.
- RN 232 seems to be unsigned (as of 2014-15).
- RN 242 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-38.5060229,-70.4672872,3a,39.4y,313.12h,80.19t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1si7tl4_2HukX27YrZSLbnUA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).
- RN 259 [is signed](https://radio3cadenapatagonia.com.ar/en-pocas-semanas-habra-novedades-sobre-la-pavimentacion-de-la-ruta-259/).
- RN 260 seems to be unsigned (as of 2014), but the only imagery available is at the east end.
- RN 281 has been extended west to Chile, but the latest imagery available (2014) shows [RP 43](https://www.google.com/maps/@-47.0133625,-67.2598466,3a,44.3y,283.35h,86.5t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shxqOmyhWyFk2rlgJ2XJVxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).
- RN A001 is unsigned, but is in argsf as AvGenPaz, AccSud, and PueNicAve.
- RN A002 is unsigned, but is in argsf as AutRic.
- RN A002 is unsigned, but is in argsf as RamTig.
- RN A004 is unsigned, but is in argsf as part of Aut2.
- RN A010 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-42.7402428,-65.0402514,3a,15y,222.38h,81.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTdSJjwcRVEslE_L6yhXQ_w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) - also note the older sign for [S/N](https://www.google.com/maps/@-42.7405371,-65.040196,3a,15y,229.02h,80.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5RlMASrJTC7peaH2OLRO3w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) (sin nombre/no number).
- RN A013 seems to be unsigned (as of 2013).
- RN A014 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-31.5505221,-68.5005258,3a,17.1y,296.94h,103.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJtXsS-3d8-Qv9Wn61orvvA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN A015 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-31.2848541,-58.077599,3a,31.5y,64.15h,84.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8WQbdQdHfRW2cr2_fXMDng!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
- RN A016 seems to be unsigned.
- RN A019 seems to be unsigned, but is in argsf as AvCirCor.
- RN A022 seems to be [signed only as a second route for RN 22](https://youtu.be/8gzlCpMIhiY?t=1025), so it has been mapped as RN 22Neu.
- RN A025 seems to be unsigned (as of 2014).
- RN A026 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-40.7133845,-65.0031998,3a,15y,111.97h,84.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0MpU3xQP1cjCCQyL1beEtA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu), but perhaps not all the way to the end (available imagery is from 2014).
- RN 24CA [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-54.2313883,-67.2065627,3a,31.8y,231.82h,79.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s3xUwpKRt5hhrIUaXCGpHqg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) as RN A.
- RN 24CB [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-53.8538716,-67.7566283,3a,15y,334.25h,83.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1soEQpmAtRoEjhncm6UfBLZQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) as RN B.
- RN 24CF [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-53.8689748,-67.6908394,3a,33.1y,168.53h,80.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGGwq91xrDwcUdHPs_xxuoQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) from RN 3 as RN F, even though sources show it is not federally maintained. [Another sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-54.3386843,-67.8584494,3a,15.6y,327.78h,88.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdbpxdM77Gm2xUvDSD6yucg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) correctly shows RP 9.

[Another sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-54.3394371,-67.8566238,3a,15y,129.59h,88.91t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1siHtZph3olB3NVXAB-4Nduw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) correctly shows RP 18.
- RN 24CI's signage is unknown, but it is assumed to be signed (as RN I) given that the others are.
- RN 24CJ [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-54.7406811,-67.8312442,3a,32.5y,153.08h,79.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sW5kD7okd-rt2W5A_lccqwg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) as RN J.
