The following branches are not included:
* Gregorio Garc√≠a - Francisco I. Madero: very poorly signed; GIS and LRF only show federal maintenance in Durango
* Ramal a Otinapa: only in DV, not LRF or GIS
* route through Lerdo and Gomez Palacio: not enough signage to define

Other notes on routes:
* mex024sab has no GMSV
* mex036 has no GMSV
* mex040jua: there isn't enough information to determine if the east end should be at Uni, but km posts count down to COAH/DGO
* mex040uni: the north end is where maintenance ends; there does not appear to be any signage beyond, connecting it to other pieces of 40
* mex049cla has no GMSV; the east end may be too far west
* mex049cue: the straight route through downtown is also signed as 49, but neither route is federally maintained in the area of the split
