Notes on routes:
* SP-023 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.3311657,-46.6881006,3a,15y,323.87h,85.55t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5A4-ftmAyB5rGudEevLz_w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). The east end is where maintenance and signage ends; the west end is a little sketchy due to a gap in maintenance through Franco da Rocha.
* SP-036 has no signs near the north end; maintenance ends at SPA-003/010 (though without any signs saying so).
* SP-039 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.6861814,-46.2145589,3a,15.7y,47.07h,83.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLrD2-QRhtPcfx895QDHHxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) (as of 2011) on what sources say is actually SP-043.
* SP-043 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.6752074,-46.3500887,3a,36.6y,35.45h,79.66t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shoac_0g64ulAmSb9NO9prw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) from SP-031 despite being a low-quality dirt road. No post-2011 imagery is available elsewhere to see how it's signed.
* SP-046 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.8256856,-45.6306235,3a,36y,277.65h,85.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sPT9sgPZXR4cKcJfaLjAMNQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SP-050 does not have a well-defined or signed south end. Numerous signs in São José dos Campos point the way between SP-050 and BR-116, but sources do not show that this is SP-050 proper. The south end of SP-050 and the south end of state maintenance are somewhere north of Estrada Juca Carvalho, but again there are no signs indicating where and km posts are missing.
* SP-056 may not be signed anywhere west of the end of state maintenance in Arujá, but SPI-035/056 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.4617075,-46.3393103,3a,22.5y,337.44h,89.61t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZJw8RMPcJQDR01CtW7csiw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SP-058's east end is according to length shown in the log, due to lack of signage.
* SP-062 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.1129399,-45.7288434,3a,15.6y,247.02h,87.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swgx6UNLfixpJVot5SvnM2A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) west of Caçapava. The log shows that state maintenance ends at the border with São José dos Campos, and that SP-062 continued locally-maintained for another 2.8 km to somewhere in Eugênio de Melo.
* SP-062 has no signed or defined westbound route through Caçapava.
* SP-062 has no signed or defined route through Pindamonhangaba, so it has been split at the bypass (Anel Viario). It may in fact be completely unsigned in this area until the SPA-085/060 intersection.
* SP-062 is not signed and poorly defined through Aparecida, Guaratinguetá, and Lorena, but [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.7457959,-45.1342764,3a,15y,223.55h,90.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sg4RwOOuKLkjz48_DfZOLrg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) exists just west of Lorena. The east end in Cachoeira Paulista is poorly defined.
* SP-066 has [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.5312569,-46.3152639,3a,15y,276.07h,86.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s13mSalCxoM6sD2aOm8l2Ig!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) on the locally maintained portion through and west of Mogi das Cruzes. But if there are none actually on the route, this may not be enough given the lack of a well-defined route through Mogi das Cruzes.
* SP-066 has no signed or defined route through Jacareí. On the other hand, it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.2278201,-45.9010078,3a,41.2y,203.13h,85.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLF1MGs4OkJ3iNBG2wYFUhQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) in Dos Campos (despite the map showing it meeting BR-116 at Saída 154).
* SP-150 has an unclear south end. The Ecovias concession ends at Avenida Nossa Senhora de Fátima. Federal GIS data shows SP-150 and planned BR-050 extending to Rua Flamínio Levy. State GIS data continues SP-150 all the way to Avenida Presidente Wilson at Canal 1.
* SP-249 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.9994865,-48.8786124,3a,16.1y,205.19h,83.82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8MrOhh5DDaXdM9iHquMgAg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) in Itapeva.
* SPA-086/021 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.7180762,-46.4694927,3a,15y,82.82h,85.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-zf9qD976hEcRSMQFwg82w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) (with a missing 0).
* SPA-052/031 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.688352,-46.3925401,3a,15y,34.25h,106.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRyaEiBL2hLdKPXeffxIKAw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SPA-058/031 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.6433758,-46.3216465,3a,15y,100.14h,81.93t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sU7JpdrhaB6Ls1BjYOUqS0g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SPA-220/052 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.5706432,-44.9950992,3a,15y,99.07h,88.21t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7agpg3qodERMEe15umV3hw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192), but as of 2011 the east end is unclear.
* SPA-248/055 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.9829983,-46.2650202,3a,18.2y,285.58h,87.42t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHpNepqI08kMsoh5dUws1_A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) (with a missing 0). Sources show that it continues south to Avenida Ademar de Barros (01 SPA-248/055), but the Ecovias concession and signage end at the circle where the freeway ends.
* SPA-291/055 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.9977704,-46.4111343,3a,21.3y,278.54h,88.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss0U16t3V0_o7fyq-yD-rpA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SPA-344/055: the east end is poorly defined; it officially continues locally-maintained back to SP-055 at Per, but this is not signed.
* SPI-084/066 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.3467599,-46.0205593,3a,15y,157.05h,88.23t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTodoGdcHL2NWMrKnvZOY9Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) (with missing 0s).
* SPA-032/101 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.9846962,-47.3781872,3a,15y,168.37h,89.1t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s77uriIBHBI5JiTaDOBTHFA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192), but imagery at the south end is older, so it may extend another block.
