The following routes are not included due to apparent lack of signs:
* SP-008 segments between Mairiporã and Bragança Paulista (as of 2023)
* SPA-134/008 (municipal maintenance; assuming this is [Estrada Municipal Saturnino Rodrigues de Moraes](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.6128466,-46.5308865,3a,39.2y,119.33h,85.88t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOxAw4XTv7ItKZfDSYCgMLQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu))

* SPA-175/055 (municipal maintenance, as of 2023)

* SPA-073/066 (municipal maintenance, as of 2022)

* SPA-043/075 (as of 2023) - this also seems to be inventoried as the north end of SP-079

* SPA-115/079 (municipal maintenance, as of 2023)
* SP-092 (unpaved, as of 2023)
* 01 SPA-032/099 is not shown on maps, and its location is unclear
* SPI-065/099 is mapped as SP-099Car, since it is currently signed as the northbound lanes of SP-099 from SPI-097/055 to the top of the hill. It is unknown whether this will change in the future when SPI-097/055 is complete.

Notes on routes:
* SP-023 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.3311657,-46.6881006,3a,15y,323.87h,85.55t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5A4-ftmAyB5rGudEevLz_w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). The east end is where maintenance and signage ends; the west end is a little sketchy due to a gap in maintenance through Franco da Rocha.
* SP-043 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.6752074,-46.3500887,3a,36.6y,35.45h,79.66t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shoac_0g64ulAmSb9NO9prw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) from SP-031 despite being a low-quality dirt road.
* SP-046 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.8256856,-45.6306235,3a,36y,277.65h,85.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sPT9sgPZXR4cKcJfaLjAMNQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SP-050 does not have a well-defined or signed south end. Numerous signs in São José dos Campos point the way between SP-050 and BR-116, but sources do not show that this is SP-050 proper. The south end of SP-050 and the south end of state maintenance are somewhere north of Estrada Juca Carvalho, but again there are no signs indicating where and km posts are missing.
* SP-056 may not be signed anywhere west of the end of state maintenance in Arujá, but SPI-035/056 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.4617075,-46.3393103,3a,22.5y,337.44h,89.61t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZJw8RMPcJQDR01CtW7csiw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SP-058's east end is according to length shown in the log, due to lack of signage.
* SP-062 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.1129399,-45.7288434,3a,15.6y,247.02h,87.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swgx6UNLfixpJVot5SvnM2A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) west of Caçapava. The log shows that state maintenance ends at the border with São José dos Campos, and that SP-062 continues locally-maintained for another 2.8 km to somewhere in Eugênio de Melo.
* SP-062 has no signed or defined westbound route through Caçapava.
* SP-062 has no signed or defined route through Pindamonhangaba, so it has been split at the bypass (Anel Viario). It may in fact be completely unsigned in this area until the SPA-085/060 intersection.
* SP-062 is not signed and poorly defined through Aparecida, Guaratinguetá, and Lorena, but [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.7457959,-45.1342764,3a,15y,223.55h,90.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sg4RwOOuKLkjz48_DfZOLrg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) exists just west of Lorena. The east end in Cachoeira Paulista is poorly defined.
* SP-066 has [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.5312569,-46.3152639,3a,15y,276.07h,86.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s13mSalCxoM6sD2aOm8l2Ig!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) on the locally maintained portion through and west of Mogi das Cruzes. But if there are none actually on the route, this may not be enough given the lack of a well-defined route through Mogi das Cruzes.
* SP-066 has no signed or defined route through Jacareí. On the other hand, it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.2278201,-45.9010078,3a,41.2y,203.13h,85.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLF1MGs4OkJ3iNBG2wYFUhQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) in Dos Campos (despite the map showing it meeting BR-116 at Saída 154).
* SP-105's east end is sketchy; maps and GIS show it ending at the junction of Avenida 23 de Setembro and Rua Dr. Pedro E. Pinheiro, both of which are supposed to carry SP-360, but signs point SP-360 through traffic as Google and OSM show. The end as mapped is where the [easternmost known SP-105 sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.592155,-46.7110773,3a,15y,314.73h,86.7t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0Z3rB3iJw-CdaIKC_7NfUQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) is located.
* SP-129's south end is where state maintenance ends at km 74, since there is no signage south of there and no logical intersection with SP-157/SP-268. But [does it even exist south of Tatuí?](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.3596368,-47.8907831,3a,16y,289.78h,88.43t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sy6yNEmcp8g-Oh98-WJp6Gg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) It may become state maintained at the turnoff for Quadra.
* SP-141 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.1855933,-48.1244037,3a,15y,335.8h,89.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sEYzli8vqOeeRcZYK_6iRRw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SPA-019/143 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.0670875,-47.974411,3a,15y,262.23h,85.21t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1st6E9p0FkV2CBY7RJLvAWsA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), but 1.05 km is way too long for where the south end appears to be in reality.
* SP-147 has no well-defined east end in Piracicaba, but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.7455604,-47.6795928,3a,15y,317.2h,83.19t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sz0xkyubRn2TFIIXQRGqIww!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) where we end it.
* SP-148 appears to be partially closed to motor vehicle traffic, but is signed and walkable.
* SP-157's south end is ill-defined.
* SP-167 [was signed in 2017](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.4128485,-46.9513544,3a,15y,82.95h,87.54t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sQFhhRo34y751NA_IRuw23g!2e0!5s20170501T000000!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu), but not anymore.
* SP-189 bypasses Campina do Monte Alegre (using Rua Marcelina V. dos Santos) according to maps, but [signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.5579909,-48.4520475,3a,75y,321.41h,68.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1su0U3t7ZDmFerPDn4T07hWg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) show that the bypass is locally maintained, and distance matches the through-town route.
* SP-211 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.6525034,-46.8712168,3a,48.3y,358h,82.25t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1svOSOVX_KnPijN2kj-FMfUg!2e0!5s20150601T000000!7i16384!8i8192).
* SP-228 and SP-234 essentially intersect in a huge circle around downtown Itapecerica da Serra. One point is placed at the rough center.

The route thru Angatuba is guesswork based on limited signage for destinations and one-way streets (are there any signs west of Angatuba?). The end west of Angatuba is rough. The end in Paranapanema is guessed.
* SP-300 is closed to all traffic west of BR-262.
* SP-316's north end may be slightly off.

According to [a list from 2016](https://repositorio.ufscar.br/bitstream/handle/ufscar/10394/MASSARO_Camila_2018.pdf) (p. 58 of 105), SPA-069/255 was 4 km long, placing the transition at the southernmost turnoff for Américo Brasiliense. This is all moot since it's now signed properly.
