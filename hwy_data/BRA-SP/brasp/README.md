Notes on routes:
* SP-023 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.3311657,-46.6881006,3a,15y,323.87h,85.55t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5A4-ftmAyB5rGudEevLz_w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). The east end is where maintenance and signage ends; the west end is a little sketchy due to a gap in maintenance through Franco da Rocha.
* SP-036 has no signs near the north end; maintenance ends at SPA-003/010 (though without any signs saying so).
* SP-039 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.6861814,-46.2145589,3a,15.7y,47.07h,83.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLrD2-QRhtPcfx895QDHHxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) (as of 2011) on what sources say is actually SP-043.
* SP-043 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.6752074,-46.3500887,3a,36.6y,35.45h,79.66t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shoac_0g64ulAmSb9NO9prw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) from SP-031 despite being a low-quality dirt road. No post-2011 imagery is available elsewhere to see how it's signed.
* SP-046 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.8256856,-45.6306235,3a,36y,277.65h,85.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sPT9sgPZXR4cKcJfaLjAMNQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SP-050 does not have a well-defined or signed south end. Numerous signs in São José dos Campos point the way between SP-050 and BR-116, but sources do not show that this is SP-050 proper. The south end of SP-050 and the south end of state maintenance are somewhere north of Estrada Juca Carvalho, but again there are no signs indicating where and km posts are missing.
* SP-150 has an unclear south end. The Ecovias concession ends at Avenida Nossa Senhora de Fátima. Federal GIS data shows SP-150 and planned BR-050 extending to Rua Flamínio Levy. State GIS data continues SP-150 all the way to Avenida Presidente Wilson at Canal 1.
* SP-249 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.9994865,-48.8786124,3a,16.1y,205.19h,83.82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8MrOhh5DDaXdM9iHquMgAg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) in Itapeva.
* SPA-086/021 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.7180762,-46.4694927,3a,15y,82.82h,85.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-zf9qD976hEcRSMQFwg82w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) (with a missing 0).
* SPA-052/031 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.688352,-46.3925401,3a,15y,34.25h,106.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRyaEiBL2hLdKPXeffxIKAw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SPA-058/031 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.6433758,-46.3216465,3a,15y,100.14h,81.93t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sU7JpdrhaB6Ls1BjYOUqS0g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SPA-220/052 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.5706432,-44.9950992,3a,15y,99.07h,88.21t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7agpg3qodERMEe15umV3hw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192), but as of 2011 the east end is unclear.
* SPA-248/055 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.9829983,-46.2650202,3a,18.2y,285.58h,87.42t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHpNepqI08kMsoh5dUws1_A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) (with a missing 0). State GIS data shows that it continues south to Avenida Ademar de Barros, but the Ecovias concession and signage ends at the circle where the freeway ends.
* SPA-291/055 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.9977704,-46.4111343,3a,21.3y,278.54h,88.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss0U16t3V0_o7fyq-yD-rpA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
* SPI-084/066 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.3467599,-46.0205593,3a,15y,157.05h,88.23t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTodoGdcHL2NWMrKnvZOY9Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) (with missing 0s).
