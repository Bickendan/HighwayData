**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-17 - Charente-Maritime:*
- `D150` from Pisany to Saintes is partially signed as `N150`, partially unsigned. Source: 2022 GSV. It was renamed to `N2150` in 2008 and should have been downgraded according to wikisara but `A disagreement between the State and the Departmental Council on the conditions of this downgrading probably explains why it has not yet been reclassified as a departmental road.` https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/Route_nationale_fran%C3%A7aise_2150 OSM indicates it being `D150`. Drafted as `D150` since it is not `N150` nor signed as `N2150`.

*FRA-33 - Gironde:*
- D route signs usually disappear at the Métropole boundary, e.g. see D1010 north and south or D1215, usually with km posts at the boundary. All D routes are drafted to the Métropole boundary only. M routes are not signed (yet).
- The Bordeaux Arrondissement (also indicated on OSM) is not congruent with the Bordeaux Métropole. Thus, I'm gone with municipality names for the boundaries.

*FRA-40 - Landes:*
- `D933N` is indicated on GM and OSM but only signed at `D932` and `D392` junction according to 2021 GSV. However, it is not signed at roundabout to `A65` in-between nor further to the east, drafted as vanilla `D933`
- `D933S` is indicated on GM, OSM and 2021 GSV but only from Mont-de-Marsan to Momuy, the signs on the southern-most 5km show `D933` only, fully drafted as `D933S` though; Northern feeder to Saint-Sever is signed as `D933`, so drafted too
