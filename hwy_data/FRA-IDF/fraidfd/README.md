*FRA-92 - Hauts-de-Seine:*
- wikisara overview is very incomplete

*FRA-93 - Seine-Saint-Denis:*
- Many routes are still signed with their old `N` route numbering
- `D12` is only indicated on geoportal
- `D18` (former `A186` is permanently closed), not in HB
- `D40` segment between `D932` and `D41` is indicated being `D41` on geoportal and GM but there is a `D40` sign on 2011 and 2018 GSV and it's also indicated being `D40` on OSM
- `D402` is only indicated on 2011 and 2018 GSV, and on geoportal

*FRA-94 - Val-de-Marne:*
- wikisara overview is incomplete, route articles exist for much more routes, added everything that is confirmed by OSM and GM

*FRA-95 - Val-d'Oise:*
- `D9E` is indicated on OSM and GM but it's missing on wikisara and I couldn't find anything on GSV, added though
- `D23` is not signed but there is a SSD sign at junction with `D311`, in HB as `D234(93)`
- `D84B` not drafted since it's not indicated anywhere except of wikisara. It should end halfway between `B84B` and `D84`

**TODO:**
- Check wikisara `Liste des anciennes routes départementales` Yvelines
