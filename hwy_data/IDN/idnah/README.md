There is very little information available about these routes' exact alignments and they are [very rarely signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.7024813,113.9213964,3a,15y,81.31h,111.93t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2Xl8cRXLq21R4IOR92jc4A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-21.93291278637983%26panoid%3D2Xl8cRXLq21R4IOR92jc4A%26yaw%3D81.31142493895395!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), so they are assumed to use new freeways wherever it makes sense and national routes otherwise. The [2010 log](https://www.unescap.org/our-work/transport/asian-highway/database) (the latest available) seems to do this. Other notes from the log:
* AH2's east end seems to be on Jl Gatot Subroto at Jl Cokroaminoto in Denpasar (the first segment is listed as 11 km in the 2010 log, which makes no sense, but it's clearly shown as following 40.008.K, which may have been longer in 2010? or was the section completely moved? some sections on Java were totally renumbered, and the length does roughly match ending at the airport on N1)
* Why does AH2 include 20 km of Yogyakarta-Surakarta?
* AH2's Bandung spur seems to stay with T4 all the way to Cileunyi.
* AH2 appears to use both sides of the T1/T2/T7 loop around downtown Jakarta as well as the spur of T1 to the port/ferry.

Other notes:
* It's not clear which side of the Yogyakarta bypass AH152 follows; both are different national routes.
