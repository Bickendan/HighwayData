Many signs remain from before the 2019 renumbering, but some do refer to the new numbers (such as [N17](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.5656429,112.7176402,3a,15.1y,308.07h,103.54t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sWH9VR0mXoZOmjCiGvj9HGA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-13.54119175818687%26panoid%3DWH9VR0mXoZOmjCiGvj9HGA%26yaw%3D308.0668457968097!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)).

Notes on routes:
* Alignments thru Jakarta are from the 2007 log (note that N2 and N12 are now N8 and N6, and N13 no longer exists).
* N1 goes both ways thru Cikarang per the 2019 log, but the bypass is mapped because the downtown route cannot be followed westbound.
* N1 uses Jalan Ir. H. Juanda in Cikampek per the 2019 log, but it [is not signed this way](https://www.google.com/maps/@-6.4082123,107.4866307,3a,15.9y,224.13h,108.12t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1smqhkoSGpDe1vCAg7M9-hjw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-18.122681498273593%26panoid%3DmqhkoSGpDe1vCAg7M9-hjw%26yaw%3D224.13487536007761!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2024).

* N10 is assumed to bypass downtown Purwakarta (both routes are nationally maintained).
* N10 southbound uses a different route thru Padalarang. Since only the northbound route is nationally maintained, and several important points are on the northbound route's overlap with N11, that direction is mapped.
