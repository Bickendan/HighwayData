Notes on routes:
* ca001 seems to have had a landslide between ToHUE6 and HUE6, but maps and logs (20.95 km between Bifurcacion Colotenango and Bifurcacion La Libertad) show it still uses the old route. 2016 GMSV shows traffic to Huehuetenango also directed along the old route, with a not-so-great unpaved detour around the slide.
