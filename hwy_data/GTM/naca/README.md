Notes on routes:
* CA1 seems to have had a landslide between ToRDHUE6 and RDHUE6, but maps and logs (20.95 km between Bifurcacion Colotenango and Bifurcacion La Libertad) show it still uses the old route. 2016 GMSV shows traffic to Huehuetenango also directed along the old route, with a not-so-great unpaved detour around the slide.
* CA1: RDTOT22 is shown on maps (back to 2014) as paved, but it was a dirt track (impassable to cars?) in 2016. Hence it is a hidden shaping point.
* CA1: there is no GMSV of the Chimaltenango bypass, but there is a video on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HJ2Uf23QI
* CA1: there is no GMSV of the Barberena bypass, but there is a video on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AKlohkfElU
* CA2: RDSCH3 is signed at Sam; is this a case of the maps being wrong?
* CA2: the location of RDESC13 may be wrong.
* CA2: RDESC26 does not appear to exist as a public road, so it's a shaping point.
* CA2: signage is horrible through Escuintla, but it's not signed around the bypass.
* CA2Tec is officially CA2A but not signed as such.
* CA2B (branch from CA2Tec to MEX200) is not signed.
* CA9Nor's south end may be wrong.
* CA9Sur: the location of RDESC1 may be wrong.
* CA9SurA is not signed, but is in gtmsf as AutPalEsc and AutEscQue.
* CA10: the location of RN18_E may be wrong.
* CA10: the location of RDCHI9 may be wrong.
* CA13: the location of RDPET19 may be wrong.
* CA13: the location of RDPET23 may be wrong.
* CA13A is officially CA13, but signs are for CA13A. CA13A is shown as looping off CA9Nor thru Morales, but this is not signed.
* CA13Ele: the west end may be wrong.
* CA14: RDBV2_W is far to the south of where maps show a road.
* CA14: the north end may be too far west.
