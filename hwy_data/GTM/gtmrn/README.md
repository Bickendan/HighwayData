Notes on routes:
* RN1's route thru Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, and San Pedro-San Marcos may be wrong (if they are even defined in any official way).
* RN1: [what is CPR20?](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.8674436,-91.4680109,3a,15y,242.92h,87.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTrXteyf8aYDqOOGX0SsCcw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu)
* RN1 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.9441759,-91.8340602,3a,15.2y,47.57h,83.2t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdHia8nG7UmJKNsPq1zMfIg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) both ways (via RN1 and via RDSM44) between San Marcos and Esquipulas Palo Gordo.
* RN2 and RDSRO26 are swapped south of their intersection on the INGUAT map vs. other maps. The INGUAT map has been chosen since it seems to be more up-to-date.
* RN15 seems to have been extended south to Patzicía according to the INGUAT map, but it's not clear if this has happened.
* RN21 is shown on the INGUAT map looping off CA11 thru Los Planes.
