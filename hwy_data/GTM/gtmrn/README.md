Notes on routes:
* RN1's route thru Totonicap치n, Quetzaltenango, and San Pedro-San Marcos may be wrong (if they are even defined in any official way).
* RN1: [what is CPR20?](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.8674436,-91.4680109,3a,15y,242.92h,87.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTrXteyf8aYDqOOGX0SsCcw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu)
* RN1 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.9441759,-91.8340602,3a,15.2y,47.57h,83.2t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdHia8nG7UmJKNsPq1zMfIg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) both ways (via RN1 and via RDSM44) between San Marcos and Esquipulas Palo Gordo.
* RN2 and RDSRO26 are swapped south of their intersection on the INGUAT map vs. other maps. The INGUAT map has been chosen since it seems to be more up-to-date.
* RN5 has [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.798264,-90.6430745,3a,35.9y,26.53h,79.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHaNq-r68fmhDa7vCcUOgpQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) pointing it via RDGUA18.
* RN5's route thru Rabinal and San Miguel Chicaj may be wrong.
* RN7E's east end may be wrong.
* RN7W's transition point into RN12N is very rough.
* RN7W's route thru San Ildefonso Ixtahuac치n may be wrong.
* RN7W's route thru San Miguel Uspant치n may be wrong.
* RN8's south end may be wrong.
* RN12S's south and north ends may be wrong.
* RN13's route thru Flores Costa Cuca may be wrong.
* RN14's route thru Antigua Guatemala may be wrong.
* RN15 seems to have a gap between Tecp치n and Las Trampas; the 2017 map shows an unpaved road but there is nothing on the INGUAT map and no thru road seems to exist.
* RN19 is assumed to bypass Sanarate.
* RN21's west end may be wrong.
* RN23's west end may be wrong.
