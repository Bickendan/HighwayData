Notes on routes:
* BR-010Apa may be signed [only at the south end](https://www.google.com/maps/@-9.9470414,-47.9882976,3a,15.4y,23.23h,83.14t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sg06hWVDzU0fclcsYYV6xJQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). No imagery is available on the paved portion near Rio Sono, so only the southern paved section is included.
* BR-010Goi [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.858928,-47.5413871,3a,15y,29.5h,86.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sY8ev3teUirmpN8NFsKaddw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) on the paved portion, but may lack signs south of the end of pavement south of Morro Grande. No imagery is available there, so only the northern paved section is included.
* BR-235's status east of Pedro Afonso is unknown (federal maintenance restarts where pavement ends at the TO-010 split).
