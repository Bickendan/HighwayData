Notes on routes:
* ERS-412 may be unsigned, but [it was well-marked in 2011](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.7115186,-52.5592014,3a,23y,10.86h,78.22t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sG5wVsFIiNLQL-u5lzm3Wzg!2e0!5s20110701T000000!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu), implying that signs have simply been lost over the years.
* ERS-440 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.7765173,-51.6837483,3a,15.9y,53.42h,105.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sQRWXfMNyuin1d4W2ktF1_w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* ERS-776 seems to be unsigned.
