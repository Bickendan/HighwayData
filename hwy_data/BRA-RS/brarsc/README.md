Rio Grande do Sul Sistema Rodoviário Estadual (Estaduais Coincidentes)

These are portions of federal routes that are constructed but maintained by the state. Older signs say [RST](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.0057012,-51.4104809,3a,15.4y,211.04h,83.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssb1MMJhgTfMYFMlXcVroIQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).

Notes on routes:
* RSC-377 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.6458879,-53.5621669,3a,15.3y,117.55h,82.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srV7KIXnOQd5vNunUSREtVQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). [Signs east of Santiago](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.1457702,-54.8814701,3a,15y,81.95h,82.31t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWk6zgMOUbHUYoX2DW3M5Qw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) erroneously say ERS-377.
* RSC-386 is de facto part of BR-386 (and [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.7048392,-51.6546367,3a,15.1y,311.49h,87.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgqrJFeQpjFz4kMRjhhFF_A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) is for BR-386).
* RSC-392Ang may be unsigned, but it is included as it connects a piece of BR-392 with BR-285.
* RSC-453 ACE-9150 [is signed as RSC-453](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.1901356,-51.2476356,3a,41.6y,85.74h,79.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sppzRftgsKM8Gf8M78uKOow!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* RSC-470 seems to be unsigned; it is all locally maintained.
* RSC-471 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.6813725,-52.4581394,3a,19.2y,62.29h,78.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFxdhwBw_eA1ZcmQatErySw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), though perhaps not all the way to RSC-153.
* RSC-472's short segment around Santa Rosa seems to be signed only as ERS-344, which it is entirely concurrent with.
* RSC-473 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-32.0123226,-53.2499386,3a,17.2y,317.67h,85.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sN2QnYkV5dwgcibkWCfKVHQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) near Herval. Its end at Herval is unclear.
* RSC-473 north of Bagé [is signed on a construction sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-31.2635737,-54.1398817,3a,15y,20h,90.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sI4cFAlIyAAr0pMEF1CtsZg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) if nowhere else.
