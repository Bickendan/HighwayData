Notes on routes:
* RSC-377 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.6458879,-53.5621669,3a,15.3y,117.55h,82.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srV7KIXnOQd5vNunUSREtVQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). [Signs east of Santiago](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.1457702,-54.8814701,3a,15y,81.95h,82.31t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWk6zgMOUbHUYoX2DW3M5Qw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) erroneously say ERS-377.
* RSC-386 is de facto part of BR-386 (and [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.7048392,-51.6546367,3a,15.1y,311.49h,87.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgqrJFeQpjFz4kMRjhhFF_A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) is for BR-386).
* RSC-392Ang may be unsigned, but it is included as it connects a piece of BR-392 with BR-285.
* RSC-470 seems to be unsigned; it is all locally maintained.
* RSC-471 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.6813725,-52.4581394,3a,19.2y,62.29h,78.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFxdhwBw_eA1ZcmQatErySw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), though perhaps not all the way to RSC-153.
