**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- Generally for all departements of the region: It seems that usually only one branch of one-way sections at junctions (often around the church of the village) is dedicated as D route. Finistère shp files indicate it and signs one can spot on GSV. Drafted this way when it seems to be the best choise!

*FRA-35 - Ille-et-Vilaine:*
- Many D route signs disappeared in recent years, likely due to bypass openings and further rededications. Compared 2014 / 2015 GSV or even 2019 GSV to 2020 / 2021 GSV where available. The changes are not yet done on GM nor OSM. A detailed check is required before activation

*FRA-56 - Morbihan:*
- `D316` end not clear, route was downgraded through Baden between 2018 and 2021 (GSV from `D101` junction) but GSV south of it is still from 2018 only
