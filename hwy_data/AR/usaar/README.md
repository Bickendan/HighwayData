Unsigned concurrencies are treated as gaps between separate routes unless the concurrency follows a single route between splits in the same county

Instead of Alternate, Business, Truck, or Spur banners, auxiliary routes are posted with suffixes (i.e. AR 00 Business = "AR 00B"). Route names for these auxiliary routes follow the same convention (AR00B instead of AR00Bus, with or without city label). Signage for some spurs is "Spur #S": this is treated as a bannerless #S (similar situation with at least one truck route)

Notes:

AR9S in Izard County has 3 legs, all signed AR9S: 2 horizontal (AR9SMel) and 1 vertical (AR9SIza)

AR18 intersects AR181 twice in Mississippi County; both junctions are signed "AR 181 East"

AR32 intersects US278 twice in Hempstead County; both junctions are signed "AR 32 East"

AR35 is unsigned in Sheridan between US167Bus_N and US167_S but follows a path that was a single route before the bypass was built

AR43 intersects AR7 twice in Harrison; both junctions are signed "AR 43 South"

The two segments of AR244 in Washington County are separated by a gap (along AR59) longer than either segment

AR253 intersects AR45 twice in Sebastian County; both junctions are signed "AR 253 North"

AR88Alt is AR88 (Altheimer)

AR92 is signed N-S south of the AR9 concurrency and E-W east of it

AR94 is unsigned from AR340 to the Missouri state line

AR100 intersects AR365 twice in Pulaski County; both junctions are signed "AR 100 East" and the gap is longer than either segment of AR100

To be determined:

AR43 in OK (westward bend along OK20): AR43 is concurrent with OK20 along state line, but bends west for some distance to be totally within OK, so should have points where it crosses state line; no corresponding state-line points exist in OK20 file

AR75S is signed "Truck AR 75S"
