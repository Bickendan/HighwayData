Unsigned concurrencies are treated as gaps between separate routes unless the concurrency follows a single route between splits in the same county

To be determined:

Signage for 4S is "Spur 4S": treat as Spur 4S or normal 4S?
similar for 7S, 7T

AR9S in Izard County has 3 legs, all signed AR9S: 2 horizontal (AR9SMel) and 1 vertical (AR9SIza)

AR18 intersects AR 181 twice in Mississippi County; both junctions are signed "AR 181 East"
