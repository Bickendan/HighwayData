Unsigned concurrencies are treated as gaps between separate routes unless the concurrency follows a single route between splits in the same county

General notes:

AR9S in Izard County has 3 legs, all signed AR9S: 2 horizontal (AR9SMel) and 1 vertical (AR9SIza)

AR18 intersects AR181 twice in Mississippi County; both junctions are signed "AR 181 East"

AR32 intersects US278 twice in Hempstead County; both junctions are signed "AR 32 East"

AR35 is unsigned in Sheridan between US167Bus_N and US167_S but follows a path that was a single route before the bypass was built

AR43 intersects AR7 twice in Harrison; both junctions are signed "AR 43 South"

The two segments of AR244 in Washington County are separated by a gap (along AR59) longer than either segment

AR253 intersects AR45 twice in Sebastian County; both junctions are signed "AR 253 North"

AR88Alt is AR88 (Altheimer)

AR92 is signed N-S south of the AR9 concurrency and E-W east of it

AR94 is unsigned from AR340 to the Missouri state line

To be determined:

Signage for 4S is "Spur 4S": treat as Spur 4S or normal 4S?
similar for 7S, 7T

AR43 in OK (westward bend along OK20)

AR75S is signed "Truck AR 75S"
