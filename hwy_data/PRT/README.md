Notes:
- `IC2` is signed through Batalha (south of Leiria) on 2022 GSV although infraestruturasdeportugal.pt and OSM indicate it via A19. A19 has no IC2 signs. Keeping through through Batalha.
- `IC2` is signed north of Oliveira de Azeméis up to Arrifana (end of expressway) on 2022 GSV (and OSM) although infraestruturasdeportugal.pt indicates it heading to A32. Drafted according to GSV + OSM.
- `IC2` is again indicated from Lourosa to Carvalhos on OSM but not confirmed by GSV. Not drafted.
- `IC3 (Alcochete)` is also indicated on infraestruturasdeportugal.pt and OSM north of Alcochete but it is not signed according to 2021 GSV
