* BR-020 is signed [near Simplício Mendes](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.8747848,-41.9133934,3a,19y,58.16h,86.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skrRLC7wM34rxMjL5vfC24g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), [near São João do Piauí](https://www.google.com/maps/@-8.3715139,-42.2410493,3a,15y,61.1h,83.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smXzwfuozUCRovA2a_Liiwg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), [near Colonel José Dias](https://www.google.com/maps/@-8.8299113,-42.481243,3a,42.3y,254.6h,89.3t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRkeN4S-mKlFR1UPdmqc_-Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), [near São Raimundo Nonato](https://www.google.com/maps/@-8.9969605,-42.6822242,3a,15.6y,213.34h,86.7t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1svJ7TkheTSTfWcJeJXY5C1g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), and [at the state line](https://www.google.com/maps/@-9.431364,-42.9604646,3a,27.1y,68.3h,88.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5s6wDEOju0Z_bRJdlN70cQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). The stub north of Simpicio Mendes may not be signed, but all sources indicate that it is federally maintained. The 2023 state map shows that all is federally maintained except São Raimundo Nonato to near Coronel José Dias.
* BR-135 (not BR-235) [is the signed route](https://www.google.com/maps/@-9.4659598,-44.6442715,3a,15y,104.29h,81.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srV7J6YX78wG1WS9qqAysQg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) east of Monte Alegre do Piauí.
* BR-135 (not BR-343) [is the signed route](https://www.google.com/maps/@-7.086629,-43.5035547,3a,15y,259.37h,86.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shUu4KLk-oXrKIHBfVoRCpw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) thru Jerumenha.
* BR-222Esp's easternmost sign seems to be [km 81](https://www.google.com/maps/@-4.2512558,-41.812457,3a,75y,144.73h,80.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7anUFhWW1anDspQv8RLXKw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), which is just east of where the planned bypass leaves. The end point has been placed about 2 km to the east at a prominent change in pavement entering Piripiri.
* BR-222Esp's route thru Batalha is per destination signs. Note that the main street is one-way westbound west of Rua Ribeiro Torres, so eastbound traffic is a block to the north on Rua Benjamin Constant. Also note that (apparently) neither direction uses Travessa Francisco Castro, but westbound is one block west and eastbound is one block east. ([This sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-4.0245631,-42.0766913,3a,32.3y,319.74h,86.43t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sflGhTI-tjDQBG9Wb-C0MsQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) seems to point westbound traffic on Travessa Francisco Castro, but [signs for the next turn](https://www.google.com/maps/@-4.0232965,-42.0771913,3a,38.2y,23.28h,85.53t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1srJh7Kt3hVk3szPfvteYoFw!2e0!5s20181201T000000!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu) are a block west.)
* BR-226 seems to be unsigned east of BR-343, but the latest imagery is from 2019. What would be an overlap with BR-343 has [BR-343 on the km posts](https://www.google.com/maps/@-5.0744017,-42.7364598,3a,15y,70.18h,83.94t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s3i7Zj5iTtG_Pujw8j3LOVQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* BR-235's status near Caracol is unknown.
* BR-235 (west of BR-135) [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-9.1240223,-45.9205127,3a,75y,84.75h,105.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sUK2yLeawpoQMN5_mMKtOEQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). GIS shows the former routing to the ferry in Santa Filomena, but [the bridge is BR-235](https://www.gov.br/planalto/pt-br/acompanhe-o-planalto/noticias/2021/05/inaugurada-ponte-que-beneficiara-o-agronegocio-de-estados-do-nordeste).
* BR-404 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-4.4417492,-41.5308961,3a,15y,304.5h,82.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suALkO-ED4m4kOyzRnHX2TA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
