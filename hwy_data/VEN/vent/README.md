Notes on routes:

Sources are sparse so details may be incorrect. Some minor (ramal) routes may be in the wrong place on the 2015 maps, such as R10 and R11 near the east end of T9.
* T2's south end may be wrong.
* T3 is assumed to use the new bypass around Tucacas.
* T4's north end may be wrong.
* T4's route thru Acarigua is unknown.
* T5 is assumed to have replaced R38 west of Puente Chururú.
* T5 may end in San Cristóbal, with T7 continuing to T1 (or T1 may have been moved to the autopista like OSM shows). The 2015 map does not place a marker on the road northwest from San Cristóbal.
* T6's north end may be wrong.
* T7's route thru Guarico is unknown.
* T7 is assumed to use the new alignment at Tovar.
* T8's exact endpoints at Arismendi, El Yagual, and Guachara may be wrong.
* T9 is assumed to use the realignment in Barcelona, apparently replacing R49.
* T9 is assumed to stay on Avenida Perimetral in Cumaná (the 2015 map shows Avenida Fernández de Zerpa and Avenida Gran Mariscal).
* T10 may still be on the old alignment north of Upata; the 2015 map shows both T10 and the autopista on the old alignment.
* T11 is assumed to use the realignments south of Lago de Valencia and around San Sebastián. It may bypass downtown Villa de Cura.
* T11 and T12 are shown going thru downtown Altagracia de Orituco on the 2015 map (Miranda shows it more clearly than Guárico). T11's western approach has been almost definitely moved south from the route via Botalón, but from there it has been mapped along the route thru town, but with a short bypass that appears to carry thru traffic on aerials. T12 has also been mapped via this short bypass.
* T12 does not seem to exist as shown on the 2015 map just north of Chaguaramas, so it has been mapped with a gap.
* T12's ferry location across the Río Orinoco may be wrong.
* T12's exact south end may be wrong.
* T13 seems to have a gap north of Anaco.
* T14 does not seem to be built south of Zaraza. A portion may exist south of Santa María de Ipire, but it is unclear.
* T14's end at Las Bonitas may be wrong.
* T15 seems to have been realigned east of El Tigre, replacing R13 and part of R12.
* T16 is assumed to use the new bypass of Soledad. It may or may not bypass Ciudad Bolívar.
* T19 is assumed to bypass Guasdualito.
* T21's east end may be wrong.
