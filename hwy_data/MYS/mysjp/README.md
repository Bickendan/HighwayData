Notes on routes:
* 102's east end may be wrong, but seems to match the length of 79.23 km.
* 234 is listed as having a length of 61.66 km and thus ending at 8, but the map shows it ends at Kuala Lipis, and [some signs on 8](https://www.google.com/maps/@4.1610433,102.0323492,3a,15.2y,17.56h,88.67t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sxgBmNsbzbqd6xkaLxBJIcA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DxgBmNsbzbqd6xkaLxBJIcA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.share%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26yaw%3D17.560315474789803%26pitch%3D1.328331623347978%26thumbfov%3D90!7i13312!8i6656?coh=205410&entry=ttu) indicate no designation until beyond Kuala Lipis; however, other [newer? signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@4.1640842,102.033363,3a,37.6y,358.22h,91.81t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s16UxK1QKSU7w8ptSloJnKg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D16UxK1QKSU7w8ptSloJnKg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.share%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26yaw%3D358.22087119866876%26pitch%3D-1.8072904789094508%26thumbfov%3D90!7i13312!8i6656?coh=205410&entry=ttu) may show it's all 234.

The west end may be wrong. Page 159 of the log does show a branch to Gunung Brinchang, and it is 4 entries before 436, but the length of 3.22 km doesn't seem right.
