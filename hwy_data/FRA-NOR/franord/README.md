**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-27 - Eure:*
- Generally, OSM + GM often show routes which are not confirmed by GSV. Eure departement also seems to be bad in signposting.
- Many 3-digit D route numberings on OSM are from early 2010s (indicated with "source bing") but more recent GSV clearly shows no signs or C numbering
- `D675` Beuzeville bypass and routes around must be checked

*FRA-50 - Manche:*
- `D4` west of Pontorson belongs all the way to departement Ille-et-Vilaine (35) in BRE
- `D56E1` is just a ramp of the interchange, not drafted
- Location of `D666` unknown.
- `D973` goes through Sartilly according to shp files + GM; OSM indicates `D973` on bypass and `D973E1` through Sartilly but 2018 + 2019 GSV indicates `D973` on the bypass and `D673` through Sartilly. Drafted according to the latter.
- `D974` from east of Carentan and north of Saint-Lô (former `N174`)is missing in shp files but is indicated on OSM and GSV, partially from 2009 ; drafted
- `D975` has a gap in shp files which should be `D675` according to GM + OSM but there is not `D675` shp file. GSV has some signs indicating `D675` and some indicating `D975` - needs to be checked before activation!
