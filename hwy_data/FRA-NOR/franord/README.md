**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-27 - Eure:*
- Generally, OSM + GM often show routes which are not confirmed by GSV. Eure departement also seems to be bad in signposting.
- Many 3-digit D route numberings on OSM are from early 2010s (indicated with "source bing") but more recent GSV clearly shows no signs or C numbering
- `D675` Beuzeville bypass and routes around must be checked

*FRA-50 - Manche:*
- `D4` west of Pontorson belongs all the way to departement Ille-et-Vilaine (35) in BRE
- `D56E1` is only a ramp of an interchange, not drafted
- `D62E1` and `D62E2` are only ramps of an interchange, not drafted
- `D69E1` is only a ramp of an interchange, not drafted
- `D91E1` is signed on 2015 GSV but no shp file, not drafted
- `D101` ends in a dead end street according to shp file at south end but it is signed at the next D971 to the south on 2009 - 2019 GSV, drafted according to GSV
- `D118E1` is just a "roundabout", not drafted
- `D130E3` is only a ramp of an interchange, not drafted
- Location of `D666` unknown.
- `D973` goes through Sartilly according to shp files + GM; OSM indicates `D973` on bypass and `D973E1` through Sartilly but 2018 + 2019 GSV indicates `D973` on the bypass and `D673` through Sartilly. Drafted according to the latter.
- `D974` from east of Carentan and north of Saint-Lô (former `N174`)is missing in shp files but is indicated on OSM and GSV, partially from 2009 ; drafted
- Pont-Farcy was merged into the commune of Tessy-Bocage in 2018 and thus moved from Calvados to Manche departement. shp files are older and routes around Pont-Farcy needs to be checked; 2018 GSV already shows new numberings where available, OSM + GM still outdated!
- `D374` + `D554` + `D975` go through Pont-Farcy, more to be checked
