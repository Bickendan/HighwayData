The following branches are not included:
* Campeche - Tixmucuy: nothing is signed, and LRF only lists 2.4 km to Chiná, while GIS shows nothing
* through Campeche: only signed on the bypass

Other notes on routes:
* mex180bec: DV shows the west end at Dzitbalché, but the main road (as signed and shown in LRF and GIS) curves east north of Calkiní
* mex188: no GMSV west of Are
* mex188rui: endpoint is where pavement ends
* mex221: no GMSV
