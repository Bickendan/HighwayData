The following branches are not included:
* Acceso a Hecelchakán: LRF doesn't say exactly where this 1.5 km spur is (the 11 km loop was given to local maintenance in 1999)
* Campeche - Tixmucuy: nothing is signed, and LRF only lists 2.4 km to Chiná, while GIS shows nothing
* Parque Dzibalché: this is probably a one-way pair, erroneously listed as being federally maintained, since the main loop through Dzibalché was given to local maintenance in 1999
* Ramal a Golondrinas: no GMSV, so unknown if this minor branch is signed
* Ramal a El Mamey: no GMSV, so unknown if this minor branch is signed
* Ramal a Miguel Hidalgo: no GMSV, so unknown if this minor branch is signed
* Ramal a Pedro Baranda: no GMSV, so unknown if this minor branch is signed
* Ramal por Seybaplaya: length in LRF (3.2 km) matches the route through downtown, which can only be followed eastbound, and there is no signage other than at the two ends
* 180 through Campeche: only signed on the bypass

Other notes on routes:
* mex180bec: DV shows the west end at Dzitbalché, but the main road (as signed and shown in LRF and GIS) curves east north of Calkiní
* mex188: no GMSV west of Are
* mex188rui: endpoint is where pavement ends
* mex217jon: LRF says it's 5.1 km long, which doesn't make sense; GIS ends it at the state line
* mex221 and mex221mon: no GMSV
