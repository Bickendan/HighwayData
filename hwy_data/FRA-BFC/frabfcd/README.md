**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-21 - Côte-d’Or:*
- `M` routes Dijon are signed as we can see on 2020 GSV, was not yet in 2019
 - Not drafted through the city but ends located at the junction with last outbound sign or at next relevant junction if last sign goes inbound
 - Old `D` route signs have (rarely) be used to verify the route if GSV was older than 2020
 - End of routes located at border between departement and metropolis according to wikisara map - also confirmed by OSM M route indication as of January 2021

*FRA-25 - Doubs:*
- `D203` routing through Saint-Vit not clear

*FRA-58 - Nièvre:*
- `D39` seems to be maintained by Yonne departement, not drafted for Nièvre
- `D197` through Saône-et-Loire is most likely maintained by Nièvre (included)
- `D556` is indicated on OSM and GM but routing is not clear and there is no sign on 2009 - 2014 GSV, not drafted

*FRA-71 - Saône-et-Loire:*
- There are `B`/`BIS`but also `T`/`TER` routes. Since one sign has the full name but the next sign does often have the abbreviation only, I'm generally gone with the abbreviation which is also the standard in other departements
- `D335` is indicated on OSM and GM but 2018 GSV does not show it; there is a `D35` milepost at west end and `D35` signs to the west and to the east at `D27` junction --> route most likely belong to departement Loire's `D35` (ARA)

*FRA-89 - Yonne:*
- `D905` through GES is maintained by Yonne (mileposts with Yonne label)
