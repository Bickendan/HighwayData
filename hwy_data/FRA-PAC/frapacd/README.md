**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-05 - Hautes-Alpes:*
- Some routes are (partially) signed with `T` or `L` suffix, sometimes only indicated on OSM and / or GM. Those suffixes have been generally omitted since the route name is still unique.
- `D1T` drafted because it is a totally different route to `D1`

*FRA-06 - Alpes-Maritimes:*
- `D92` is indicated on OSM + GM in Mandelieu-la-Napoule but the junction with `D6007` is not clear; there is no sign along the route, only (old) stones; There is no `AlM` signs into `AlM` but only a sign into `Var`

*FRA-84 - Vaucluse:*
- There is another `D53` from `D942` interchange `Route Vedène` to the roundabout north of the interchange. However, the interchange ramps of the westbound carriageway are connnected via this roundabount. Not drafted.
