**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-05 - Hautes-Alpes:*
- Some routes are (partially) signed with `T` or `L` suffix, sometimes only indicated on OSM and / or GM. Those suffixes have been generally omitted since the route name is still unique.

*FRA-06 - Alpes-Maritimes:*
- `D92` is indicated on OSM + GM in Mandelieu-la-Napoule but the junction with `D6007` is not clear; there is no sign along the route, only (old) stones; There is no `AlM` signs into `AlM` but only a sign into `Var`
