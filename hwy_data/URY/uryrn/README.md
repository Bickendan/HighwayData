**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- RN4 has 3 segments according to wikipedia, OSM and GM but I could only find signs on the northernmost segment (other segments not drafted); southern segment is not covered by GSV
- RN7 seems to be only signed up to RN26
- RN38 is b/n RN6 and RN7 according to GM, not visible on GSV, only partially indicated on OSM west of RN7. wikipedia indicates that RN38 is in Maldonado at the sea
