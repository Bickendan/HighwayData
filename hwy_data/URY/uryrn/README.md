**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- RN4 has 3 segments according to wikipedia, OSM and GM; southern segment is not covered by GSV but is drafted.
- RN6 road condition is unknown between Pue329 and Feos, very poorly signed portion; it's possible that 6 doesn't even exist here south of the ferry
- RN19 east end is not clear
- RN25's national maintenance ends east of Guichón, and is not signed, see review comment on the forum. Drafted because indicated on OSM + GM
- RN38 is b/n RN6 and RN7 according to GM, not visible on GSV, only partially indicated on OSM west of RN7. wikipedia indicates that RN38 is in Maldonado at the sea, GIS agrees with Wikipedia; It is a small locally maintained route only, not drafted
