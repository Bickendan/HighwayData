**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- RN4 has 3 segments according to wikipedia, OSM and GM but I could only find signs on the northernmost segment (other segments not drafted); southern segment is not covered by GSV
- RN7 seems to be only signed up to RN26
- RN25 routing in Guichon is not clear
- RN38 is b/n RN6 and RN7 according to GM, not visible on GSV, only partially indicated on OSM west of RN7. wikipedia indicates that RN38 is in Maldonado at the sea
- RN40 is unsigned
- RN42 should have a second segment according to wikipedia but nothing indicated on OSM, GM nor GSV
- RN46 seems to continue west of RN36 but the endpoint (and even the route) is different on GM and OSM
- RN50 is indicated on GM from RN1 to RN54 but on OSM/wikipedia from RN1 to RN22 only. The only sign I could find on GSV is on RN54, added
