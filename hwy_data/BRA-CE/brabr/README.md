* BR-222's bypass around Umirim is in GIS as BR-222C, but [km posts](https://www.google.com/maps/@-3.6809226,-39.3414001,3a,15.3y,102.46h,87.23t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1se8IM3yytSfbBqr2x7hckmQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) show BR-222. ([The old route](https://www.google.com/maps/@-3.6765109,-39.342508,3a,18.3y,96.04h,87.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snmTSqO3yyvUVVqo1eyL9tA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) also has BR-222 km posts, so is mapped as BR-222Umi.)
* BR-226 was [signed as CE-275](https://www.google.com/maps/@-5.998184,-38.6129556,3a,26.6y,171.51h,84.26t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scvYD0K8Cc9eyvvCxxDSD3Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) east of BR-116, but now it's [signed as BR-226](https://www.google.com/maps/@-6.03931,-38.4754153,3a,39.7y,258.66h,82.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sM0pDm_gIFoStkaljv-Rs7g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
