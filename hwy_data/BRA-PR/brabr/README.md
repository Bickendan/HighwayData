Notes on routes:
* BR-158 does not seem to be signed along the unpaved piece between Campo Mour√£o and Roncador (GIS shows federal maintenance ending at the plaza in Roncador). Also, as of 2022, BR-158 is [clearly signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.8923791,-52.3264122,3a,41.8y,186.98h,85.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1soxxwi_mIBo3SgH9Ia-7GWw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) to end north of Peabiru where the bypass ends, rather than in downtown Peabiru where GIS shows federal maintenance ending and the planned route turning west.
* BR-369 appears to not be signed west of BR-376.
* BR-376: GIS shows federal maintenance continuing north to the center of Nova Londrina, but there are no signs beyond the curve on the outskirts (where the Viapar concession ends).
