Notes on routes:
* BR-158 is assumed to be signed between Campo Mour√£o and Roncador now that paving is done.
* BR-369 appears to not be signed west of BR-376.
* BR-376: GIS shows federal maintenance continuing north to the center of Nova Londrina, but there are no signs beyond the curve on the outskirts (where the Viapar concession ends).
