Notes on routes:
* BR-153Uni has a gap in maintenance through Imbituva, but signs are posted (using Rua Santo Antônio instead of Avenida Sete de Setembro). It may cross the state line several times south of União da Vitória, but I don't have good info on exactly where the border is, and no signs are posted.
* BR-158 does not seem to be signed along the unpaved piece between Campo Mourão and Roncador (GIS shows federal maintenance ending at the plaza in Roncador). Also, as of 2022, BR-158 is [clearly signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.8923791,-52.3264122,3a,41.8y,186.98h,85.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1soxxwi_mIBo3SgH9Ia-7GWw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) to end north of Peabiru where the bypass ends, rather than in downtown Peabiru where GIS shows federal maintenance ending and the planned route turning west.
* BR-158Mar seems to be mostly unsigned, but [at least one construction sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.8905521,-52.2564705,3a,15y,270.77h,82.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9BF2w1iICHcYKM9WjV_d1w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) calls it BR-158.
* BR-369 appears to not be signed west of BR-376.
* BR-376: GIS shows federal maintenance continuing north to the center of Nova Londrina, but there are no signs beyond the curve on the outskirts (where the Viapar concession ends).
* BR-467 may be unsigned, even [on the independent portion in Cascavel](https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.9149451,-53.4885105,3a,37y,328.75h,85.14t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sNatY9wt3SmVx0prCQ7cqnQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
