Notes on routes:
* BR-158 is assumed to be signed between Campo Mourão and Roncador now that paving is done. On the other hand, there were no signs (as of 2018) along Avenida São Pedro into downtown Roncador, where GIS shows federal maintenance ending at the plaza.
* BR-369 appears to not be signed west of BR-376.
* BR-376: GIS shows federal maintenance continuing north to the center of Nova Londrina, but there are no signs beyond the curve on the outskirts (where the Viapar concession ends).
