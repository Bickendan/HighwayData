**FORUM THREAD:**- https://forum.travelmapping.net/index.php?topic=5169**SOURCES:**- https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Landesstra%C3%9Fen_in_Ober%C3%B6sterreich- https://www.land-oberoesterreich.gv.at/37083.htm**NOTES TO ROUTES:**- `L543` is indicated b/n `B151` and `B154` with a length of 4.382km; Total length b/n `B151` and `B154` is 4.4km. However, Salzburg's `L217` is indicated with a length of 4.394km too. However, from B151 to Seeache; Seeache is where the state border is. Gone with state border to divide the routes.- Some routes have different start or end points on the 2024-01-01 list compared to the official DORIS map (October 2023 version). If so, I've gone with DORIS because the 2023-01-01 list version is usually the same like 2024-01-01. e.g. `L1255` still indicates `B1` as end point but the Lambach bypass was opened in 2016.
