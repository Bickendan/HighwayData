**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-10 - Aube:*
- Routes through Troyes are often signed inbound at `D610` ring road but not within the city. Only routes drafted through the city when the routing is obviously.
- `D77` through BFC is signed a mileposts indicating `Aube`
- `D79E` is only signed on 2010 GSV at `D179`

*FRA-52 - Haute-Marne:*
- `D2A` is just a one-way street to the north in Wassy while the southbound street is `D2`, not included but threated as `D2` for wp location
- `D65B` is indicated being `D65A` on OSM but GSV has only a `D65B` sign
- `D65C` might be considered to be a ramp of the interchange of `D65` and `D65B` only but since it can be driven two-way with a redundant relation to the big interchange... Added
- `D111` and `D157` are not signed through Saint-Dezier

*FRA-54 - Meurthe-et-Moselle:*
- `D2H`, `D2M` and `D2N` are indicated on OSM and GSV but not on GM/wikisara. Added though.
- `D2L` is indicated on OSM, GM and GSV but not on wikisara. Added though.
- `D6` extends into Vosges and back to Meurthe-et-Moselle. There are `D6` signs in Vos. Included.
- `D22A` is indicated on GM, GSV and wikisara but not on OSM. Added though.
- `D22E` is indicated on GM and wikisara but not on OSM or GSV. Not in HB.
- `D33` and `D33A` are partially indicated on OSM and GM but there is only one `D33A` sign at the junction of both routes. Not in HB.
- `D39`, `D92A`, `D93`, `D92A`, `D92B` and `D92C` are indicated on OSM and GM (western Nancy) but not on wikisara nor GSV. Start and end points not clear. Not in HB. If they would exist they had most likely been renamed to Mxxx.
- `D92` is indicated on OSM and GM through western Nancy but not on wikisara nor GSV. End point not clear, set to western city entrance.
- `D199` end point is wild guess, only signed at roundabout with `D400`
- `D974B` is the old alignment - bypass opened in 2018 or 2019 - which is still indicated being `D974` on OSM, to be checked before activation
- It seems that some route segments are dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!): https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/M%C3%A9tropole_du_Grand_Nancy (`M2`, `M32`, `M71`, `M83`, `M112`, `M321`,`M400`,`M570`, `M974`)

*FRA-55 - Meuse:*
- `D1916` is only signed `Voie Sacrée`, in HB as `fran` route `NVS`
- `D145x` routes are drafted as good as possible. OSM is partially incorrect, GSV not fully available
- `D163B` is only indicated on GM but not on OSM nor OSM - not included

*FRA-57 - Moselle:*
- `D8A` is indicated on GM and wikisara but not on OSM/GSV. Added though.
- `D33` exist according to OSM and GSV but GM claims that the northern segment is `D82A`
- `D77` extends into Meurthe-et-Moselle and back to Moselle but there are no `D9` mileposts in MeM (km12 still in Mos, km13 again in Mos) - not included
- `D104K` is signed as `C4` at `D37` junction but there is a `D104K` sign at the entrance of Glasenberg, whole route in HB
- `D199D` is missing, `D199` is likely signed incorrect since no other `D1xx` route exists without suffix
- It seems that from 2020-01-01 some route segments will be dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!): https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/Metz_M%C3%A9tropole#En_g.C3.A9n.C3.A9ral (`M1`, `M6`, `M7`, `M11`, `M69`, `M157A`,`M157B`,`M603`, `M643`, `M652`, `M657`, `M903`, `M913`, `M953`, `M954`, `M955`, `M999`)

*FRA-88 - Vosges:*
- `D2F` end not clear dur to lack of GSV coverage. It is signed at junction with `D2` (2011 GSV) and it is not signed at junction with `D9` (2018 GSV). It crosses the border to BFC and back to GES
