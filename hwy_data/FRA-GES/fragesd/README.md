**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-54 - Meurthe-et-Moselle:*
- `D2H`, `D2M` and `D2N` are indicated on OSM and GSV but not on GM/wikisara. Added though.
- `D2L` is indicated on OSM, GM and GSV but not on wikisara. Added though.
- `D22A` is indicated on GM, GSV and wikisara but not on OSM. Added though.
- `D22E` is indicated on GM and wikisara but not on OSM or GSV. Not in HB.
- `D33` and `D33A` are partially indicated on OSM and GM but there is only one `D33A` sign at the junction of both routes. Not in HB.
- `D35`, `D41` and `D43` not yet added due to lack of info whether they exist at all and where
- `D39`, `D92A`, `D93`, `D92A`, `D92B` and `D92C` are indicated on OSM and GM (western Nancy) but not on wikisara nor GSV. Start and end points not clear. Not in HB. If they would exist they had most likely been renamed to Mxxx.
- `D92` is indicated on OSM and GM through western Nancy but not on wikisara nor GSV. End point not clear, set to western city entrance.
- `D199` end point is wild guess, only signed at roundabout with `D400`
- `D974B` is the old alignment - bypass opened in 2018 or 2019 - which is still indicated being `D974` on OSM, to be checked before activation
- It seems that some route segments are dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!): https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/M%C3%A9tropole_du_Grand_Nancy (`M2`, `M32`, `M71`, `M83`, `M112`, `M321`,`M400`,`M570`, `M974`)

*FRA-57 - Moselle:*
- `D8A` is indicated on GM and wikisara but not on OSM/GSV. Added though.
- `D33` exist according to OSM and GSV but GM claims that the northern segment is `D82A`
- `D77` extends into Meurthe-et-Moselle and back to Moselle but there are no `D9` mileposts in MeM (km12 still in Mos, km13 again in Mos) - not included
- `D104K` is signed as `C4` at `D37` junction but there is a `D104K` sign at the entrance of Glasenberg, whole route in HB
- `D199D` is missing, `D199` is likely signed incorrect since no other `D1xx` route exists without suffix
- It seems that from 2020-01-01 some route segments will be dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!): https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/Metz_M%C3%A9tropole#En_g.C3.A9n.C3.A9ral (`M1`, `M6`, `M7`, `M11`, `M69`, `M157A`,`M157B`,`M603`, `M643`, `M652`, `M657`, `M903`, `M913`, `M953`, `M954`, `M955`, `M999`)

*FRA-88 - Vosges:*
- `D9` extends into Meurthe-et-Moselle and back to Vosges. There are `D9` milepost in MeM. To be included.
