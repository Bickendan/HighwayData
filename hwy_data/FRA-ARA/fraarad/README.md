**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-03 - Allier:*
- `D28` extends into Cher (departement 18 in CVL) more than once. The border sign is a little bit off the actual border and the pavement change is in CVL. Route extended to next junction at `D951`
- `D951` of Cher (departement 18 in CVL) has a short segment in ARA but there are no signs at the border, no pavement change and a km post indicating km48, should belong to fracvld18 system

*FRA-38 - Isère:*
- `D36` (Chasse-sur-Rhône) extends at west end according to wikisara and GM but not according to GSV and OSM. Signs have been removed between 2008 an 2015 according to GSV.
- `D41I` should be `D41L` according to wikisara and GM but it is clearly signed as `D41I` on GSV. OSM confirms it. Note: upper case letters are generally used.
- `D63I` should be `D65L` according to wikisara and GM but it is clearly signed as `D65I` on GSV - with lower case `i`. OSM confirms it. Only exception with lower case index.
- `D208` should extend through Bourgoin-Jallieu according to wikisara and GM but OSM indicates it being `D522` and 2019 GSV doesn't show anything being signed.

*FRA-43 - Haute-Loire:*
- The second `D9` segment south of Saint-Bonnet-le-Froid must belong to the ARA Ardeche departement (fraarad07). `D9` is signed at the junction and there is a `Info Ardeche` sign along the route.
- `D12` through Loire seems to be maintained by Haute-Loire
- The second `D45` segment in the south of the departement (OSM + GM, no GSV available) seems to belong to OCC Lozère departement (fraoccd48)

*FRA-63 - Puy-de-Dôme:*
- Some route segments will be dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!)
- wikisara articles are rare but OSM + GM look good
- `D80` is signed on km posts till 1km north of `D983` but as `D80A` at `D983` junction, drafted as `D80` only
- `D224D` is indicated being `D224E` on OSM and GM; `D224D` is confirmed by 2012 GSV

*FRA-73 - Savoie:*
- OSM is sometimes outdated, new D route signs often appeared just on 2019 GSV

*FRA-74 - Haute-Savoie:*
- OSM is sometimes outdated, new D route signs often appeared just on 2019 GSV
- `D19` in Gaillard is not indicated anywhere on 2019 GSV nor 2009 GSV but it is clearly indicated on OSM and GM, added!
- `D909E` is indicated on OSM and GM but I couldn't find any sign. Route addded but needs to be checked again before activtion.
