Minas Gerais Rodovias Estaduais Coincidentes

These are portions of federal routes that are constructed but maintained by the state. As with the plain state routes, they are included whether or not they are signed due to the sorry state of route signage.

Some older signs say MGT rather than MGC: [120](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.3475405,-42.6135232,3a,15y,183.36h,84.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sror-hQAvp_Q9WcFoYXTGZw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), [259](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.7463714,-44.4512689,3a,40.4y,119.62h,81.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_SNTwG9WdDxIM-Z6TOhoCw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), [262](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.9773508,-43.420552,3a,15y,289.63h,86.53t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sY2cjU_PPwQJ4LmJySDffvA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), [496](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.4012338,-44.4617075,3a,41.5y,321.93h,105.46t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skwUHa206Vxb5bb3yPjqSGg!2e0!5s20111001T000000!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu).

Notes on routes:
* MGC-120 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.7517973,-43.0260273,3a,15.3y,260.6h,90.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8Q1CLaNq6wU2lTEuYlsQHA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* MGC-120's northbound route in Ponte Nova is unclear. There is no left turn from Avenida Francisco Vieira Martins onto Avenida Doutor Otávio Soares or Rua Professora Campolina; perhaps the intended route is to go beyond the latter and turn around at the circle.
* MGC-122 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-16.2069575,-43.5924275,3a,40.9y,256.08h,83.44t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sez0kojZyWRul_i7N3euLsQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* MGC-135 is signed as both MGC-135 and BR-135, so it is included as part of BR-135.
* MGC-146 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.7010606,-46.934189,3a,17.2y,169.86h,85.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sr-Oc7adDoGP0RS82rmJAtA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* MGC-146's southbound route thru São João Batista do Glória is unclear; northbound is shown in sources as using Avenida Avelino Soares Resende to Rua Maceió and then jogging west one block to Rua Recife.
* MGC-146's route north of downtown Passos (between SanCasa and RuaGoi_E) is unclear due to one-way streets. Sources show Avenida Arouca, Rua Doutor Bernardino Vieira, and Rua Álvares Cabral to reach Rua Barão de Passos. This can almost be followed northbound, but southbound traffic towards MG-050 west is directed around on Rua Goiás and Rua Canajeranus.
* MGC-154 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.9392163,-49.4464443,3a,31.4y,34.56h,84.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-MglDmc9dLOqZwdwwr1R0g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* MGC-154 [is signed as BR-154](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.9690135,-49.5060787,3a,18y,194.06h,83.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s22Tnyft2ZWQADQrw24HslA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) south of BR-365.
* MGC-251 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-15.9877501,-41.4054286,3a,15.4y,144.98h,81.82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sCSM1BHwiDXdQ-qG6zkakqA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), including [east of Ibiaí](https://www.google.com/maps/@-16.7860393,-44.7520098,3a,15y,289.69h,81.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sD7bnYc8c1SXoCmBf9Drhyg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* MGC-251 [is signed as BR-251](https://www.google.com/maps/@-16.7666578,-46.1329342,3a,30.9y,288.42h,81.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAAiBd8ymWsFeYkQbRjjQ_g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) from MG-181 to MG-188.
* MGC-259 [is signed as MGT-259](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.7463714,-44.4512689,3a,40.4y,119.62h,81.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_SNTwG9WdDxIM-Z6TOhoCw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) west of Curvelo. Signs east of Curvelo are for BR-259.
* MGC-262 is signed as [MGT-262](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.9773508,-43.420552,3a,15y,289.63h,86.53t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sY2cjU_PPwQJ4LmJySDffvA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) and [MG-262-C](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.903711,-43.6669826,3a,15.3y,226.29h,92.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWFKv3zeQv_VEMm6rKqm3fQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) (the latter using an alignment different from the interactive map, apparently moved between 2013 and 2019).
* MGC-262 may have a gap in Barão de Cocais; the interactive map shows an unbuilt northerly bypass, but a new bypass has recently been built (on a different alignment).
* MGC-262's portion near its west end that has been bypassed by BR-262, as shown on the interactive map, is [signed as MG-05](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.8583698,-43.9107046,3a,15y,118.73h,86.77t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssDpNc_6hJlXmCEIe1QjgCw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* MGC-265 east of Miraí [is signed as BR-265 but labeled as a state road in text](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.2010622,-42.6046577,3a,24.8y,132.34h,79.66t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-ZtQXMVef-Jsq8msul9dXA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* MGC-265 is shown between Miraí and Guidoval on the interactive map, but not in any other sources, so it is not included.
