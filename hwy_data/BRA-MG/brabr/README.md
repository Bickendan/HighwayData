Notes on routes:
* BR-135 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-14.5927825,-44.1499438,3a,36.8y,208.72h,84.3t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sR5G8PRMi_d6PoAqj9MG2wg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) along the state-maintained portion between Montalvânia and Manga. Signage south of Itacarambi is unknown; a random sampling of km posts shows [basic signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@-15.9459888,-44.2920309,3a,21.3y,191.21h,80.72t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7Kgsr-zpcA09eCxtUULmpA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) with no route number.
* BR-164 has a piece under construction southeast from Tapira to either Sâo Roque de Minas (per state map) or BR-464 (per GIS), but there is no imagery available for most of the route, so no way to know if it is signed.
* BR-251Una: all sources show that federal maintenance ends at Par, but it is [signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-16.7666578,-46.1329342,3a,30.9y,288.42h,81.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAAiBd8ymWsFeYkQbRjjQ_g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) with km posts east of there
* BR-259 is probably unsigned between BR-381 and BR-116 north of Governador Valdares, but there is no imagery available on the unpaved portion.
* BR-267 is signed from [BR-164](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.7440915,-46.4022485,3a,15.5y,108.23h,84.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1svCcfeiawu0bbCHHOqwrklQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) east to [Machado](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.6897935,-45.9009599,3a,33.1y,319.52h,80.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stBVP2M9kXyQ6KXkh_HN0vQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu). A [very old sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.9687383,-44.9264546,3a,15y,345.4h,90.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-wtfZOZjL9jcO5HgNiysmw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) exists at Caxambu, as well as [an erronous pentagon](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.9561688,-44.9735214,3a,15y,289.46h,83.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9awLlVLPYyMFkRe4d2KC2A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), but this may not be enough if there's nothing to the west.
* BR-356 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.3940333,-43.4360972,3a,18.8y,79h,82.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sBK_yz3sn_EbBVOJKYK09vg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) east from where GIS and maps show its east end, but at the next junction [it's MG-262](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.3845796,-43.4074088,3a,15.7y,247.22h,80.77t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sKPaA1FAajR7FG4JskvqNlg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* BR-459 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.8094441,-46.4696532,3a,16.4y,192.01h,83.47t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s36gQ8qiNKjghV62vgalPoA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) on its former alignment; sources show that it has entirely moved to a planned alignment between 2020 and 2023. There seem to be no signs for BR-459 inside the Poços de Caldas bypass, but [BR-146 is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.7905847,-46.5381044,3a,15.8y,135.18h,84.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sQ4sr5agxl-Oy2AwSmzxIhA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
* BR-491 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.3338243,-46.3706745,3a,17.5y,293.37h,83.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_FdE7a9Oqr5h8PB4NHRYZQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) despite sources showing state maintenance, including [north of BR-265](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.9213381,-46.9733992,3a,37.6y,142h,83.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWRSwKT5g3Qpo0H4Spf69qg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) where it's not even inventoried as planned.
