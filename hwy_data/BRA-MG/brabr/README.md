* BR-259 is probably unsigned between BR-381 and BR-116 north of Governador Valdares, but there is no imagery available on the unpaved portion, and it connects the signed federally-maintained portion to the east with the signed state-maintained portion to the west.

* BR-459 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.8094441,-46.4696532,3a,16.4y,192.01h,83.47t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s36gQ8qiNKjghV62vgalPoA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) on its former alignment; sources show that it has entirely moved to a planned alignment between 2020 and 2023. There seem to be no signs for BR-459 inside the Poços de Caldas bypass, but [BR-146 is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.7905847,-46.5381044,3a,15.8y,135.18h,84.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sQ4sr5agxl-Oy2AwSmzxIhA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).

Its route thru Lambari is how the state interactive map shows MGC-460 going, and seems to match the signed truck route east of Avenida Doutor José Nicolai Mileo.
* BR-461 seems to be unbuilt, despite it being listed in the log.
* BR-462 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.4182426,-47.2891671,3a,36.3y,138.14h,85.88t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sN8YGYxnBLU9VG2Vp0p1iFA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) south from BR-452, but there are no signs at all at the south end at BR-262. Given the lack of imagery along the unpaved state-maintained route, it has been mapped as MGC-462.
* BR-464 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.6256756,-46.5175174,3a,43.7y,317.05h,86.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suIQsR2MtTEkY6MNNczUAPA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).

* BR-482 is signed with a [normal marker](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.6514239,-43.7572185,3a,46.8y,80.39h,79.29t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sNhl-xrhY85v8hYTzSR92lw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) and [BR-482 in a pentagon](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.6754041,-43.0980005,3a,33.6y,272.79h,89.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sKOU5ZNw0jgCvI_K4F55apg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).

* BR-491 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-21.3338243,-46.3706745,3a,17.5y,293.37h,83.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_FdE7a9Oqr5h8PB4NHRYZQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) despite sources showing state maintenance, including [north of BR-265](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.9213381,-46.9733992,3a,37.6y,142h,83.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWRSwKT5g3Qpo0H4Spf69qg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) where it's not even inventoried as planned.
