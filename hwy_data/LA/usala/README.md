LA8 is signed along both I-49 and LA1 in between junctions. The northern segment linking I-49 to LA1 is considered LA8Spr by LA DOTD but is not signed as such, so it is not included in the set.

LA26 is signed W-E at its west end and S-N at its south end.

LA29Spr is the western segment of LA26 (Chataignier St) within the one-way pair of US167/LA10 in Ville Platte.

LA44 is signed W-E at its east end and S-N at its north end.

LA77 is signed along LA77 Spur, and the adjacent section of LA77 is unsigned.

LA124's route through Harrisonburg is not completely clear since LA8 was routed onto a new bridge.

The northern segment of LA486 is (mostly) unsigned.

The western end of LA611-1 is unclear.

LA987-3 and LA987-3Spr are both signed on the same road, and what appears to be the spur is signed LA987-3, so the shorter road will be drafted as LA987-3Spr.

LA1055 is not signed along LA450 or LA38 according to GMSV, so the 2 segments of LA1055 will be drafted separately.
