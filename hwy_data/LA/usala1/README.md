LA8 is signed along both I-49 and LA1 in between junctions. The northern segment linking I-49 to LA1 is considered LA8Spr by LA DOTD but is not signed as such, so it is not included in the set.

LA26 is signed W-E at its west end and S-N at its south end.

LA29Spr is the western segment of LA26 (Chataignier St) within the one-way pair of US167/LA10 in Ville Platte.

LA1055 is not signed along LA450 or LA38 according to GMSV, so the 2 segments of LA1055 will be drafted separately.
