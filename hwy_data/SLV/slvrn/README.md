Routes are included whether or not they are signed (most seem to be completely unsigned, but at least [RN21](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=13.67700656000271&lng=-89.3060120069847&z=17.630859556595418&focus=photo&pKey=342185961278676&x=0.6332411889827558&y=0.18491382862761369&zoom=1.0459938118274714) is signed).

Notes on routes:
* RN2's west end may be wrong; it is based on the 2019 and 2020 maps.
* RN3's west end may be wrong.
* RN7 [is at least partly signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.8062944,-89.2386918,3a,22.3y,325.36h,137.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAF1QipPsco91H0OY9AOv7RX0kqeL90Yt4eWU0WDIC26Y!2e10!7i7680!8i3840?entry=ttu) as CA1A.
* RN14's route thru Santiago de Maria may be wrong.
* RN23 [is the new Perif√©rico Claudia Lars](https://www.transparencia.gob.sv/institutions/fovial/executing_works/7323).
