* Nakhon Pathom: Nth -> Nthm
* Narathiwat: Nth -> Nthw
* Sa Kaeo: Sk -> Skw
* Si Sa Ket: Sk -> Sks
* Samut Sakhon: Skh -> Skhr
* Songkhla: Skh -> Skhl

Notes on routes:
* Xy015 may not make it to Xy2008.
* Xy3011's km posts were painted over between 2019 and 2021, but [new ones](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.2186746,100.4961082,3a,55.4y,12.72h,58.42t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBN6Gqa0MH0VPNUVn533yJg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D31.57602881518997%26panoid%3DBN6Gqa0MH0VPNUVn533yJg%26yaw%3D12.723113730840183!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) were installed between 2022 and 2023. The reasons are unknown, but the route definitely still exists.
* Xy4014's south end may be wrong.
* Xy3027 was renumbered [Xy2027](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4103706,100.7069188,3a,15.4y,73.43h,82.61t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjdvjbOrzPUlGN0qfK2feww!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.390088292187556%26panoid%3DjdvjbOrzPUlGN0qfK2feww%26yaw%3D73.43126000988009!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) when Thl33 replaced Thl329.
* xy5035's south end may be wrong, but it matches [km 5](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.3845608,100.5227553,3a,44.9y,62.48h,51.76t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sgOJmzuqcAicSCLnkEsyPDA!2e0!5s20190401T000000!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D38.237008919403834%26panoid%3DgOJmzuqcAicSCLnkEsyPDA%26yaw%3D62.47721261267129!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu).
* Xy2054's north end may be wrong; some signs show Xy3013 on both sides of the waterway.
