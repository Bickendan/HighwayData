* Narathiwat: Nth -> Nthw
* Sa Kaeo: Sk -> Skw
* Si Sa Ket: Sk -> Sks
* Samut Sakhon: Skh -> Skhr

Notes on routes:
* Nb1036 (connection between Nb3021 and M9) [seems to be unsigned](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.0083301,100.4614079,3a,15y,312.13h,88.46t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s1OCaSeCu1-DN1lN3_39ECw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D1.5437297787531605%26panoid%3D1OCaSeCu1-DN1lN3_39ECw%26yaw%3D312.1263051245251!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) (as of 2024).
* Nb5038 (Maha Chesadabodindranusorn Bridge approach) seems to be unsigned (as of 2024).
* Kth1001 (Kanlapa Phruek Road) [seems to be unsigned](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.6864997,100.4256721,3a,15y,230.03h,90.22t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stt1t2UY2yyOooQmHLp3zjA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-0.22440957399078343%26panoid%3Dtt1t2UY2yyOooQmHLp3zjA%26yaw%3D230.02621149164864!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) (as of 2024).
* Kth1002 and Kth1003 (Prachim Ratthaya Expressway frontage roads) seem to be unsigned (as of 2024).

* Pth3028's route near its north end may be wrong.
* Sp4008 may be unsigned, but it is currently under construction, so it has been included.
* Sp4010 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.5431315,100.4567371,3a,15.1y,45.86h,84.3t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sxIylqeb_wqcKtOMtZOzcyQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D5.696321961092366%26panoid%3DxIylqeb_wqcKtOMtZOzcyQ%26yaw%3D45.86188141100817!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu), though the east end is west of where the 2023 log shows it.
* Xy3011's km posts were painted over between 2019 and 2021, but [new ones](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.2186746,100.4961082,3a,55.4y,12.72h,58.42t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBN6Gqa0MH0VPNUVn533yJg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D31.57602881518997%26panoid%3DBN6Gqa0MH0VPNUVn533yJg%26yaw%3D12.723113730840183!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) were installed between 2022 and 2023. The reasons are unknown, but the route definitely still exists.
* Xy1023 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.3264634,100.8079347,3a,75y,131.37h,70.28t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sotox0C9OiSPtJjW3OspqmQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D19.722549904264255%26panoid%3Dotox0C9OiSPtJjW3OspqmQ%26yaw%3D131.37290691480968!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu).
* Xy3027 was renumbered [Xy2027](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4103706,100.7069188,3a,15.4y,73.43h,82.61t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjdvjbOrzPUlGN0qfK2feww!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.390088292187556%26panoid%3DjdvjbOrzPUlGN0qfK2feww%26yaw%3D73.43126000988009!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) when Thl33 replaced Thl329.
* Xy5034's north end is shown [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.2365252,100.2998855,3a,75y,336.51h,70.25t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sSYCpgBl8I5-meUkDMalodA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D19.75008652594512%26panoid%3DSYCpgBl8I5-meUkDMalodA%26yaw%3D336.51006736426166!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) in the 2023 log, but it [has been extended](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.2389919,100.2983786,3a,23.3y,140.12h,86.43t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjHX0vqocZTSxQCSvvKN5dA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D3.5681233840386994%26panoid%3DjHX0vqocZTSxQCSvvKN5dA%26yaw%3D140.1189936366062!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu).
* Xy5037's east end may be wrong.
* Xy3052 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.5286366,100.5780217,3a,28.6y,176.62h,61.57t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBFZr6vDPW5tQAKctI_tOLg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D28.425950012607117%26panoid%3DBFZr6vDPW5tQAKctI_tOLg%26yaw%3D176.61819655310717!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu).
* Xy2054's north end may be wrong; some signs show Xy3013 on both sides of the waterway, while the 2023 log has it as mapped except for not crossing the bridge at the north end.
* Xy4056 seems to be signed as part of [Xth2033](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.5287331,100.5124734,3a,15y,293.89h,85.44t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sle3jhoPbDiIg8uSnKLlIRw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D4.56135206954562%26panoid%3Dle3jhoPbDiIg8uSnKLlIRw%26yaw%3D293.8862609004332!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) (as of 2022), unless Xy4056 is supposed to be on the other side of the waterway.
* Xy6057 (parallel to and south of Xy3006) seems to be unsigned (as of 2019), though it's probably newer than 2019.
* Xy015 may not make it to Xy2008.
* Xy017's north end may be wrong.
