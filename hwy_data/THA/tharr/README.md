* Si Sa Ket: Sk -> Sks

* Pth3028's route near its north end may be wrong.
* Sb1022 may not exist south of the Ban Klab turnoff.
* Sb5043's west end may be wrong.
* Sb5048's west end is at 3022 per the length in the 2023 log (and signage), but the coordinates are at the railroad.
* Sb4052 is mostly signed as Sp5052, but [the newest signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.3005232,100.942657,3a,15y,187.69h,86.87t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sUuZkVdGc-g5i9Dznh3m2MA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D3.1337581846886167%26panoid%3DUuZkVdGc-g5i9Dznh3m2MA%26yaw%3D187.6851933258978!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) say 4052.
* Sb3057's south end may be wrong.
* Sh2006's north end may be wrong; the 311/3285 fits the coordinates and description in the 2023 log but not the length. There is no signage north of [km 8](https://www.google.com/maps/@15.0074579,100.3352149,3a,28.6y,339.37h,65.46t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sMLPTq7xvGzTyGA9x8YmYWg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D24.536629130002524%26panoid%3DMLPTq7xvGzTyGA9x8YmYWg%26yaw%3D339.3743096380178!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu).
* Sh4030 does not fit the numbering system; it should be Sh3030, but it intersects Thl3030.
* Sh4051 seems to no longer exist, despite [at least one faded km post](https://www.google.com/maps/@15.0093917,100.2695246,3a,15y,191.74h,78.1t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sPn4_hY7lRT9HSDIBIlGkNg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D11.899233617341295%26panoid%3DPn4_hY7lRT9HSDIBIlGkNg%26yaw%3D191.74487991822144!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu).
* Sp4008 may be unsigned, but it is currently under construction, so it has been included.
* Sp4010 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.5431315,100.4567371,3a,15.1y,45.86h,84.3t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sxIylqeb_wqcKtOMtZOzcyQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D5.696321961092366%26panoid%3DxIylqeb_wqcKtOMtZOzcyQ%26yaw%3D45.86188141100817!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu), though the east end is west of where the 2023 log shows it.
* Xth4012's west end may be wrong; it is based on the length in the 2023 log (the coordinates show it reaching Xth4005).
* Xth4017 is unsigned south of 33 ([signs were removed](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.5540785,100.3881268,3a,35.9y,358.23h,74.77t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s3XFTXCg8O-9NuA4y82ukjA!2e0!5s20210301T000000!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D15.230519173341776%26panoid%3D3XFTXCg8O-9NuA4y82ukjA%26yaw%3D358.2312250385387!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) and km posts were painted over between 2021 and 2022).
* Xth5021 signs were removed and km posts painted over north of 3195 between 2022 and 2024.
