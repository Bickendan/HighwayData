* Nakhon Pathom: Nth -> Nthm
* Narathiwat: Nth -> Nthw
* Sa Kaeo: Sk -> Skw
* Si Sa Ket: Sk -> Sks
* Samut Sakhon: Skh -> Skhr
* Songkhla: Skh -> Skhl

* Chb5085 [appears on an old fading sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.2918544,100.9426002,3a,15y,19.72h,107t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s3BbKITlZEr7xPFpofulhRw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-17.001392142939494%26panoid%3D3BbKITlZEr7xPFpofulhRw%26yaw%3D19.718316509518232!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) but seems to no longer exist.

* Chch029's south end may be wrong.
* Chch3028 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.6925166,100.8651376,3a,16.8y,96.36h,90.88t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqvZH0QYAfRIwFKmYcQ8tRg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-0.8794132031643898%26panoid%3DqvZH0QYAfRIwFKmYcQ8tRg%26yaw%3D96.36352313669514!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) from Chch3001, but there is probably nothing else south of the end as shown in the 2023 log, and the route in between is cut by a railroad.
* Chch4043 is not in the 2023 log, but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.492848,101.5447495,3a,75y,168.79h,71.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1ssnOig0QEcgPJ8U67nKnXyA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D18.506296208017943%26panoid%3DsnOig0QEcgPJ8U67nKnXyA%26yaw%3D168.79419593404543!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2024). Signs were installed in 2023-2024.
* Chch4044 is not in the 2023 log, but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.5000983,101.6189436,3a,32.8y,26.75h,82.92t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1srk8e3fvWVQ4G7GDTjAQdvw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.0784731213591385%26panoid%3Drk8e3fvWVQ4G7GDTjAQdvw%26yaw%3D26.752106356159388!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2022). Since the sign looks old, and no other signage can be found, it is assumed to no longer exist.
* Chch4057 is not in the 2023 log, but it [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.4498927,102.0011984,3a,29.9y,228.4h,72.18t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sfanQfCgXszZ8qAZTG4BksQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D17.823928964456286%26panoid%3DfanQfCgXszZ8qAZTG4BksQ%26yaw%3D228.4023249997827!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2024). At its west end, it [replaced part of Chch3009](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.4202985,101.7655613,3a,15y,20.82h,85.95t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1saSMseLAiXordxy7RQQTh8Q!2e0!5s20130501T000000!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D4.054829003215872%26panoid%3DaSMseLAiXordxy7RQQTh8Q%26yaw%3D20.820298449371542!7i13312!8i6656?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). At its east end, the 2023 log calls it Skw7091.
* Chm4030's north end is probably wrong.
* Chm4039's north end may be wrong.
* Chm3044's south end may be wrong; the 2023 log seems to show it continuing to Lph2047, but there is no good road or signage south of the mapped end.
* Chm4049's alignment may be wrong.
* Chm4055 seems to be unsigned (as of 2024), but there is only imagery near the south end.
* Chm3059's north end may be wrong.
* Chm3064 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@19.3857849,98.9706686,3a,15y,87.71h,88.44t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2O4_X1WjUohxQ4nFWJfJnw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D1.5620099805733219%26panoid%3D2O4_X1WjUohxQ4nFWJfJnw%26yaw%3D87.71236928988992!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (as of 2022). Chm4100 [was signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@19.3188916,98.971597,3a,48.9y,81h,79.21t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sUB0YY4v02f2VG72sktIolQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D10.788992670860097%26panoid%3DUB0YY4v02f2VG72sktIolQ%26yaw%3D80.99865483742931!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) on a portion farther south, but signs were removed between 2022 and 2023. This seems to have been an error, since the south end [was signed as PAOChm4100](https://www.google.com/maps/@19.3025707,98.9691081,3a,16.4y,54.5h,85.15t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s_XwewQ_rT5EIc4GTDeefGQ!2e0!5s20150501T000000!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D4.845875817767194%26panoid%3D_XwewQ_rT5EIc4GTDeefGQ%26yaw%3D54.50070578181979!7i13312!8i6656?coh=205410&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Thus it is assumed that Chm3064 exists all the way to Chm3047.
* Chm5066's west end may be wrong.
* Chm4067 doesn't seem to be signed at its north end, so it may not exist all the way.
* Chm4075's south end may be wrong.
