**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- No evidence that `Fv47` branch in Haugesund is signed, not mentioned on wikipedia. Indicated on OSM and vegvesen.no/vegkart
- `Fv118` branch to `E6` exit 1 should be signed now but GSV is out-dated (2009/10), not drafted
- `Fv120` and `Fv128` must be checked for exact E18 wp locations and labels
- `Fv128` end points are not clear. According to vegvesen.no, the east end is at E18 exit west of Ørje but GSV is out-dated (2010) and GM/OSM don't indicate it (unsigned Fv818); west end is `E18` on vegvesen.no, OSM indicates it east of Elvestad only; both are not drafted
- `Fv130`, `Fv131`, `Fv132` and `Fv153` are listed on wikipedia but they are unsigned county or communal roads
