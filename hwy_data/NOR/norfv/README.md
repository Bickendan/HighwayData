**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- No evidence that `Fv47` branch in Haugesund is signed, not mentioned on wikipedia. Indicated on OSM and vegvesen.no/vegkart
- `Fv118` branch to `E6` exit 1 should be signed now but GSV is out-dated (2009/10), not drafted
- `Fv130`, `Fv131`, `Fv132`, `Fv153`, `Fv161`, `Fv162`, `Fv163` and `Fv182` are listed on wikipedia but they are unsigned county or communal roads (the article can easily be identified because the titles have an additional name in brackets)
- `Fv155` segment from E18 to east of E6 is a municipal road of Oslo city and only signed with dotted frame which means "to Fv155" according to GSV from 2016; confirmed by vegvesen.no; segment not drafted
- `Ring 2` (former `Fv161`) is a municipal road of Oslo city but signed like Fv routes; not drafted though
- `Ring 1` is signed like `Ring 2` but state-owned `Rv162` according to wikipedia but no `Rv162` signs according to GSV from 2016
- `Fv168` eastern segment is a municipal road of Oslo city and not signed according to GSV from 2016 (was signed in 2010 though)
- `Fv256` according to wikipedia description (and GM) is `Fv319` according to vegvesen.no and OSM; not drafted
- `Fv313` is interrupted because the Holmestrandtunnelen is closed since 2012 https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmestrandtunnelen
- `Fv568` has a very short segment (0.03mi) on Fedje island but I couldn't see any sign on GSV
- `Fv589` is only the southbound tunnel (Sydnestunnelen in Bergen) of the northern segment from `Fv588`: not drafted
- `Fv714` still u/c till fall 2020 (new route drafted) https://www.trondelagfylke.no/vare-tjenester/prosjekter/prosjekter-i-trondelag/Fv_714_Laksevegen/
