Notes on routes:
* BR-393 seems to be unsigned from Muqui to Conceição do Muqui (federally-maintained unpaved road).
* BR-447 does not seem to be signed yet.
* BR-482 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.9251844,-41.0788858,3a,38y,304.19h,80.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sKpK6tqHi6mdnqFdKsSXOPA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) from BR-101, even though GIS and the state map show that federal maintenance begins at Ita.
* BR-482 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.7909205,-41.0804803,3a,27.7y,237.71h,84.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWbYYiaf6gPOQaJIbMVZthg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) along the ES-164 overlap, which GIS and the state map show as state maintained.
* BR-484 seems to be unsigned from Itarana to Serra Pelada (federally maintained, but partly unpaved).
