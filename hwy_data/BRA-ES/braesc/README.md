Notes on routes:
* ES-381 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.766212,-40.4725771,3a,54.3y,358.1h,81.21t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sL47gSu158Kdz8-oCDWyorA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) west of ES-137. East of SC-137, km posts are for BR-381.
* ES-482 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.793675,-41.1549285,3a,15.5y,57.83h,83.65t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAoeeh1Jk3QSW8IoIB21YzQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) as ES-482 and BES-482.
* ES-484 is signed [south of Afonso Claudio](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.1007275,-41.1198597,3a,15y,244.58h,88.68t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s36bhIq_EYiNhmjHZxL8BOA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) and [south of Guaçuí](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.8253772,-41.7044051,3a,41.6y,132.55h,86.1t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5xinIyzQteLFx2Ydn0_hdA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), but BR-262 to Guaçuí may be unsigned (and BR-484 is planned on a new alignment in state and federal sources). It seems to be unsigned north of Itarana, but it completely overlaps ES-164 there (which also seems to be unsigned).
