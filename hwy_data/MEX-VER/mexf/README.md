The following branches are not included:
* Libramiento de Coatepec: no number assigned anywhere
* Ramal a El Higo: barely signed; according to LRF it was given to the municipality in 2002
* San Pablo Villa de Mitla - T. C. (Tuxtepec - Palomares): not signed or maintained in Veracruz
* route through Acayucan: poorly signed
* route through Rinconada: signed as VER 140 or VER blank

Other notes on routes:
* mex127poz: the south end is very poorly defined
* mex130zap: DV puts the west end at 4 km, GIS puts it at the pavement change at 5 km (where we currently end it), and LRF says it's 24 km long (!)
* mex150yan has blank federal shields at both ends instead of 150
* mex180hue: the east end is ill-defined
* mex180tec: the east end is where the street becomes one-way
* mex185sot: it's not clear where the north end is
