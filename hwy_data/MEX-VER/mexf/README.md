Other notes on routes:
* mex125man: the east end is at the sign saying federal maintenance ends; there is no such signage at the supposed federal portion east of town
* mex127poz: the south end is very poorly defined
* mex130zap: DV puts the west end at 4 km, GIS puts it at the pavement change at 5 km (where we currently end it), and LRF says it's 24 km long (!)
* mex150yan has blank federal shields at both ends instead of 150
* mex180hue: the east end is ill-defined
* mex180tec: the east end is where the street becomes one-way
* mex185sot: it's not clear where the north end is
