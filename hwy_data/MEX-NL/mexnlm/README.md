Notes:
M2 may continue east or west
M4 M31 was signed at the east end, but it no longer is and I can't find any other current or former signage there
M6 probably continues east and west but I can't find any more signs
M18 it's signed on M39 but not somewhere that makes sense
M21 no signs south of M20
M26 no idea how to handle westbound, which is clearly signed on Washington/Garza Sada past M9-A
M32 I can't find any signs west of AvePedInf
M32Cen only signed at east end
M34 not sure if it continues east
M37 signed to continue south from M12, but I can't find any signage beyond
M38Nic may continue east
M39 not sure where the south end is, so I put it where pavement changes; I can't find any signs north of M910
M40 may continue east
M42 Does this continue west?
M47 I can't find any signs south of M16
M210 not sure how to handle the south leg
