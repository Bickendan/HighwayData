Notes on routes:
* BR-020 appears to be unsigned north of BA-235 (this part is unpaved but federally maintained).
* BR-030 appears to be unsigned on the unpaved but federally maintained portion from Carinhanha west to the state line, but there is no street view on most of it. The mostly-unpaved section east of Sussurana also seems to be unsigned, except for [at least one construction sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-14.3525118,-40.3320716,3a,15y,153.4h,87.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sECf1Gr5SoK6eGtsW6fLNrA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) on the paved connection from BR-116 to Boa Nova and [at least one state-posted sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-14.2277792,-39.0929345,3a,15y,351.99h,84.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8zahtKQEmIyxNLzEjlaQhw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) east of Ubaitaba.
* BR-235 [is signed](https://youtu.be/lGgngPTsxPs?t=127) around Canudos.
* BR-324 may be almost entirely unsigned west of BR-407 to Umburanas. Except between Marotinho and Jacobina, this segment was taken over federally between 2013 and 2018, but as of 2022 it doesn't seem to be signed, and [the west end](https://www.google.com/maps/@-10.7226732,-41.306337,3a,17.7y,286.51h,113.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sDe6Sjxdl5ZMfCN6HcTaDfg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) is signed as BA-368. There is [at least one nonstandard sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-11.1649918,-40.5474246,3a,32y,171.29h,86.29t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sn4YgarvYgN8WIKzXhM4_bg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) at Jacobina.
* BR-367 is unsigned west of BR-101 (as of 2019 near the state line and 2014 elsewhere).
