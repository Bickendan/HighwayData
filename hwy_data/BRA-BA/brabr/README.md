Notes on routes:
* BR-020 appears to be unsigned north of BR-235 (this part is unpaved but federally maintained).
* BR-030 appears to be unsigned on the unpaved but federally maintained portion from Carinhanha west to the state line, but there is no street view on most of it. The mostly-unpaved section east of Sussurana also seems to be unsigned, except for [at least one construction sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-14.3525118,-40.3320716,3a,15y,153.4h,87.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sECf1Gr5SoK6eGtsW6fLNrA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) on the paved connection from BR-116 to Boa Nova and [at least one state-posted sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-14.2277792,-39.0929345,3a,15y,351.99h,84.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8zahtKQEmIyxNLzEjlaQhw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) east of Ubaitaba.
* BR-116 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-14.8566421,-40.7978941,3a,15y,224.63h,85.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sB1EVxxv0Dmzpxy1My1auHA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) on the loop around Vitória da Conquista.
* BR-122 seems to be unsigned north of BR-030, except on [construction signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@-13.8420217,-42.3983512,3a,16.3y,233.49h,87.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGtJnzyg6yrzEC4kXupr21A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).

* BR-135 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-12.3574364,-44.9785133,3a,15.6y,227.58h,88.77t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sSVPHarfVYCBPuFIcGnBebQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) to use the in-town bypass of São Desidério, despite what GIS shows.
* BR-135 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-13.164236,-44.6147327,3a,75y,3.55h,80.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfTEyQaV7BqF-ajSUo05bHQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) north of Correntina.
* BR-135 was added to GIS between 2020 and 2023 from Correntina south to BA-172 (SaoFelCor), but it doesn't seem to be signed or even completely built.
* BR-135 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-14.2761921,-44.5182613,3a,17.6y,205.25h,88.89t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAwyvdNA30_WUSpBS5krwog!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) south of Cocos.
* BR-235's and BR-407's alignments at Juazeiro are from GIS, due to an utter lack of signage.
* BR-242 [is signed on construction signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@-12.7364021,-39.184843,3a,15y,196.68h,92.89t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssQfUCZOxzuOq_uZu6KOAwA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) east of BR-116 on what sources show is partly no longer BR-242. Due to the inconsistencies, this has not been mapped.
* BR-324 may be almost entirely unsigned west of BR-407 to Umburanas. Except between Marotinho and Jacobina, this segment was taken over federally between 2013 and 2018, but as of 2022 it doesn't seem to be signed, and [the west end](https://www.google.com/maps/@-10.7226732,-41.306337,3a,17.7y,286.51h,113.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sDe6Sjxdl5ZMfCN6HcTaDfg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) is signed as BA-368.
