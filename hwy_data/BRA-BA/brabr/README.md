Notes on routes:
* BR-235 [is signed](https://youtu.be/lGgngPTsxPs?t=127) around Canudos.
* BR-324 may be entirely unsigned west of BR-407. Except between Marotinho and Jacobina, this segment was taken over federally between 2013 and 2018, but 2019 GMSV photos near Capim Grosso don't turn up any signs.
* BR-367 is unsigned west of BR-101 (as of 2019 near the state line and 2014 elsewhere).
