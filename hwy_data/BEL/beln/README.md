- `N22`, `N23` and `N24` are unsigned (GSV/wegenwiki) but indicated on OSM/GM

--------- (checked from here to the end)
- `N72a`, `N388`, `N389`, `N408`, `N585`, `N630a`, `N635`, `N656`, `N861` and `N864` should be signed according to OSM but not on GM nor GSV
- `N200`, `N324`, `N344`, `N346`, `N360`, `N386`, `N470a`, `N496`, `N502`, `N509`, `N521`, `N555`, `N581`, `N607`, `N661`, `N664`, `N686`, `N768`, `N802`, `N868`, `N876`, `N877`, `N880`, `N902`, `N963` and `N998` should be signed according to OSM and GM but not on GSV

- `N241` should exist according to OSM east of `N261`only but not on GM/GSV; GM only west of `N261` but not up to `N6`; drafted according to OSM only
- `N266` is signed at junction with `N266` according to GSV but only indicated on OSM further to the north; drafted according to GM
- `N290` is indicated `N296` on OSM but it's signed `N290` according to 2013/2018 GSV in Brussegem (not yet on 2009 GSV)
- `N317` should exist according to OSM and GM but not on GSV; extends to west and east according to GM
- `N320` should exist according to OSM and GM but not on GSV (`N358` at `N9` junction on 2017 GSV)
- `N518` is still u/c b/n N513_W and N58
- `N540` was signed at N57 according to 2010 GSV but not indicated on OSM nor GM
- `N631` was signed at both ends according to 2009 GSV but not indicated on OSM nor GM
- `N653` is not signed on the southern part but indicated on OSM and GM
- `N772` is also indicated on GM from Koersel to the south (not extended)
- `N89`/`N820`/`N833`/`N834`/`N860` in La Roche-en-Ardenne: Signage has been changed as you can see on GSV. Moving the position and signs disappear... I've gone with OSM, no evidence that `N820` is really signed.
- `N813` (partially P1 on signs) and `N862` (partially P7 on signs) should exist according to OSM but not on GM nor GSV
- `N905` should exist according to OSM and GM but not on GSV (`N80` towards `N80` and `N90` towards `N90` only)
- `N917` should exist according to OSM but not on GM or GSV (GSV shows a `N947` sign, wikisara also calls it `N947a`)
- `N931` is not signed west of A4 according to GSV and OSM. GM shows two routes

- `N955` route is different on OSM/GM and not signed on GSV
