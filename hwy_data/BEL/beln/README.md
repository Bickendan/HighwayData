- `N542`, `N560`, `N699` should exist according to wegenwiki but not on any map

- One-way streets are generally not drafted when they have just an additional or different prefix, e.g. `N114a`, since that's what our rules say
- `N24` is not signed according to wegenwiki and only indicated on GM
- `N34g` should exist (not being signed) according to wegenwiki (length of just 200m) and wikisara but it's not indicated on GSV nor GM and OSM seems to indicate it wrong (not from N34 to the station but from the station to the north)
- `N40a` should exist according to wegenwiki but is no longer indicated on OSM, GM nor verkeerscentrum.be as-of 2023 (assuming being downgraded)
- Spa-Francorchamps Circuit bypass should be signed `N62c` according to OSM and GM but not on GSV, included to `N62`
- `N96a` should be signed according to wegenwiki but not on any map
- `N114b` is indicated on OSM + wegenenverkeer.be, but not on GM nor GSV. It is just a short connection between `N114` and a feeder for `A12` The feeder is signed as `A12` (as all interchanges) and not in HB. The feeder has two wps at `A12`, i.e. there is no natural end point for `N114b` if we would extend it onto the feeder

- `N600` is signed on km post as `N617e`, confirmed by geoportal
- `N603` should exist according to wegenwiki but wikisara indicates it being the old numbering of new `N3g` which is confirmed by OSM + geoportal
- `N625` is indicated on OSM but not confirmed by GM, June 2023 GSV nor geoportal; however, OSM was only changed  in January 2023
- `N628` is just a very short dirt road branching off N68 just north of N672, only indicated on wegenwiki and geoportal
- `N662` should exist according to wegenwiki but was likely what is `N633d` now
- `N661` and `N665` should exist according to wegenwiki and GM but not on OSM, GSV nor geoportal
- `N694` should exist according to wegenwiki but was likely what is `N3i` now
