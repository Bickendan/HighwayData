The following branches are not included:
* T. C. (Zihuatanejo - La Mira) - Lázaro Cárdenas: there is not enough information in sources or on signs to define this exactly
* route through Uruapan: unsigned
* route through Zamora: barely signed

Other notes on routes:
* mex051 has no GMSV for most of it
* mex120 has no GMSV between Nueva Italia and Ario de Rosales
* mex200sic: at least in 2009, there was no signage indicating a south end; GIS puts the end of maintenance at AveMor, while DV and LRF show 9 km, which may take it down a road that didn't exist yet in 2009
