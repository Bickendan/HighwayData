**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- `I8` should be truncated near the new D8 section and signed `II608` but I'm not sure where I8 will begin, at I63 or I13? There's also no info when it will be implemented.
- `I26`: Stankov bypass was opened in November 2016; No info about `II185` routing (to southern or northern I26 junction?)
