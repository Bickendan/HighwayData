Red Vial Paraguaya

Signage is rare and not assumed for all routes.

Sources:
* Maps: https://www.mopc.gov.py/index.php/red-vial (the KML file is more up-to-date than the maps)
* Definitions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjObDssBrt5bAKarEtFHbuWAxbdzfVnl/view?usp=drive_link

Notes on routes:

Sources show both bypass and thru routes being part of the numbered route. The main route is always mapped via the bypass unless otherwise stated.
* PY01, PY02, and PY03 have assumed one-way pairs in Asunción; Chile is chosen for northbound traffic due to the endpoint being at Plaza de los Héroes. Westbound PY02 is especially unclear, so the route with the fewest turns (General Aquino and Félix de Azara) has been chosen.
* PY04 may not be on the Pilar bypass; the KML shows PY 19 using both routes, but nothing on the southeast quadrant of the bypass (did it open later?).
* PY04's west end may be wrong; the KML shows a partly-unbuilt extension to Laguna Sirena.
* PY12's route just east of PY05 may be wrong.
* PY14's east end may be wrong.
* PY16's route near Filadelfia may be wrong; sources show it much straighter than roads allow for.
* PY17 may have other short segments in the gap.
* PY18 is assumed to use the new alignment to Puerto Mayor Otaño east of PY07. Its east end may be wrong.
* PY21's east end may be wrong.
* PY21 is assumed to use the new alignment east of Vaquería.
