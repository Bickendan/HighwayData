The following branches are not included:
* Chemax - Cobá: poorly signed; only in DV as a highway with federal and state portions
* Muna - Santa Rosa, Tzucacab - Peto: no longer federally maintained since 2006; new signs show state shields
* Progreso - Celestún: only in DV as a highway with federal and state portions
* route through Conkal and Chicxulub Pueblo: poorly signed
* route through Motul: poorly signed

Other notes on routes:
* mex176chi: the north end is at Calle 25 per GIS, Calle 23 (km 27) per DV, and Calle 21 (km 27.1) per LRF; given the strange one-way pair, Calle 21 may be the most logical as being in the middle of it
* mex281: the end in Celestún is poorly defined
* mex295: the north end is where the one-way pair begins
* mex295pan: the north end is roughly at km 18, where DV and LRF say it ends
