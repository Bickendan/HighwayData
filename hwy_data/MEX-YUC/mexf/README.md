Other notes on routes:
* mex176chi: the north end is at Calle 25 per GIS, Calle 23 (km 27) per DV, and Calle 21 (km 27.1) per LRF; given the strange one-way pair, Calle 21 may be the most logical as being in the middle of it
* mex281: the end in Celestún is poorly defined
* mex295: the north end is where the one-way pair begins
* mex295pan: the north end is roughly at km 18, where DV and LRF say it ends
