Other notes on routes:

* mex119luc: the west end is at km 3
* mex119tla has no signed southbound route downtown
* mex119xic: GMSV is too old east of MEX136Laz_W
* mex136ben: the north end may be too far south
* mex136cua: the north end is poorly defined; the distance in LRF means it makes a complete loop around town
* mex136hid: the south end is based on the length of 10.5 km
* mex136san: the south end is where pavement changes to stones
* mex136yau: the north end is poorly defined
