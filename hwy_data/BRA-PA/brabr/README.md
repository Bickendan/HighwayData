Notes on routes:
* BR-163: sources indicate that between 2020 and 2023, federal maintenance was cut back to PA-431, but [km posts](https://www.google.com/maps/@-2.4892553,-54.7331551,3a,33y,66.13h,84.94t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sXTxFVTHfnzgrN6zE-CKE2Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) still exist north of there as of 2022
* BR-230Ita: GIS shows that the end of federal maintenance was cut back from EstBIS to west of AvTap between 2020 and 2023. However, BR-230 [is signed leaving the ferry](https://www.google.com/maps/@-4.2728818,-55.979288,3a,24.1y,94.65h,107.65t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqLHHt1h4-jr3PTJGhSLJXQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), so for continuity it has been extended to the ferry. Note that signs point westbound like OSM shows but eastbound like Google Maps shows.
* BR-308 may be unsigned east of Bragan√ßa.
* BR-422 seems to be unsigned other than on [construction signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@-4.2532315,-49.9436389,3a,15y,111.44h,90.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssMsqREBz7ICucRaxjZe70w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
