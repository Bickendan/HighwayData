**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- The old alignment of A3 Stip - Kocani is still indicated as A3 on March 2023 data albeit a parallel A3 expressway was opened in December 2022. The expressway is indicated as "(avtopat)". We don't have the old alignment in HB. I will add a R road once I will have spot it in official data.
- The old alignment of A1 Demir Kapija - Smokvica is still indicated as A1 on March 2023 data albeit a parallel A3 motorway was opened in 2019. The expressway is indicated as "(avtopat)". We don't have the old alignment in HB. I will add a R road once I will have spot it in official data.
- The old alignment of A2 Rankovce - Kriva Palanka is still indicated as A2 albeit a parallel A2 express road was opened in 2025. We don't have the old alignment in HB. I will add a R road once I will have spot it in official data.
- The 2025 opened new A2 section should feature three interchanges but OSM does not yet indicate them. To be added later.
