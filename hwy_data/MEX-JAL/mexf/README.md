The following branches are not included:
* Guadalajara - Tesist√°n: only appears in DV; not signed
* routes through Lagos de Moreno: very poorly signed if at all

Other notes on routes:
* mex023cha: the south end is ill-defined, with DV continuing it west all the way to 15 at Entronque Jocotepec, and LRF and GIS showing federal maintenance only north of 35 at Entronque Santa Rosa; signage exists at least north of Chapala
