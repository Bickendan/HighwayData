Notes on routes:
* R-72 does not appear to be signed, but it's a freeway so it belongs in chlsf.
* R-74 is not officially designated, though with a Código of 73A00074 it should be. Anyway, it's in chlsf as Avenida General Velásquez.
* R-77 does not appear to be signed, but it of course belongs in chlsf as Autopista Nororiente. But the number was only assigned in 2012, so it's possible it's been signed since 2015 (the latest GMSV available).
* R-79: ditto; signs are for Acceso Sur
