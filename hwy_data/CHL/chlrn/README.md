Notes on routes:
* R-5: it's not known whether this turns east on V-970 to the ferry, but it is definitely [signed on the bypass at V-895](https://youtu.be/e1PGaGp692k?t=434).
* R-5Cas: according to the [2018 log](http://www.vialidad.cl/areasdevialidad/gestionvial/Documents/redvialnacional2018.pdf), the south end is at km 1271.375 (GalRiv). GIS shows the route turning left at RamFre to the waterfront at Jorge Vivar. And according to a [2009 decree](http://www.vialidad.cl/areasdevialidad/vialidadurbana/Biblitoteca%20Decretos/DSN_583_13-04-2009_X.pdf), it turns left at CGomGar to reach the ferry slip. Due to the lack of signage, ending the route at CGomGar may be most logical.
* R-71 is erroneously [signed as G-71](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.1492543,-70.794179,3a,41.3y,260.07h,80.47t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_QnHVbP3oqBs_vAyLWmiYg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) despite existing as a national route since 1998 (and previously being part of R-57). But at least [one text sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.1604532,-70.7936792,3a,20.9y,10.63h,89.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sEatV3vB3ahGe0OJ198jxkA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) does call it R-71.
* R-72 does not appear to be signed, but it's a freeway so it belongs in chlsf.
* R-73 does not appear to be signed on the route, but is [on R-57](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.2496832,-70.6976737,3a,15y,323.79h,100.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seCLsAzom1KM044dkgCiUJQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
* R-74 is not officially designated, though with a Código of 73A00074 it should be. Anyway, it's in chlsf as Avenida General Velásquez.
* R-77 does not appear to be signed, but it of course belongs in chlsf as Autopista Nororiente. But the number was only assigned in 2012, so it's possible it's been signed since 2015 (the latest GMSV available).
* R-79: ditto; signs are for Acceso Sur
